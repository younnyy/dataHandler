China US,How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor,2025-11-10T00:17:37.214Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yl88wd3lo,"You probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been the in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa, The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead. This American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. ""The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,"" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. ""This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market."" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. ""We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity"". Sepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. ""To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,"" she says. ""So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants."" Ms Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. ""There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,"" she says. ""You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc."" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative. One US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa is in South Africa's Gauteng province. ""It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,"" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa. However, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick. He argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough. ""Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,"" says Prof Branstetter. Going forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haihambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."
China US,China launches new aircraft carrier in naval race with the US,2025-11-07T08:00:25.247Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e0yx39g5o,"China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds. Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships. China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up. The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong. State media hailed the Fujian as a ""major milestone"" in the development of China's navy. The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian. The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea. State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: ""Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!"""
China US,Devastating toxic spill seen as test of whether African countries will stand up to China,2025-12-02T06:02:35.007Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nly288j4o,"Even before the dam collapsed, Lamec did not feel safe working at the copper mine. ""If our work protective gear gets damaged, it is not always replaced,"" he tells us. ""We have to take a risk and use it again."" He is talking to the BBC in a car on a quiet backroad near a village in northern Zambia, too nervous to speak to us in public or to use his real name, for fear that speaking to the press might cost him his livelihood. When he turned up for his shift one day in February, he tells us, he found that one of the dams at the Chinese-owned mine had been closed. The tailings dam - used to store toxic by-products from the copper mining process, including heavy metals like arsenic, mercury and lead - had collapsed into a tributary connected to the Kafue, Zambia's longest river and a major drinking water source. At least 50,000 tonnes of acidic debris spilled out into the surrounding waterways and farmland, according to the government. Some environmentalists, however, claim as much as 1.5 million tonnes was spilled, with one expert saying a full clean-up could take longer than a decade. The spill has killed the fish around the towns of Chambishi and Kitwe, made the water undrinkable and destroyed crops, farmers have told the BBC. There are fears that, now the rainy season has started, heavy metals still sitting in the mud will further infiltrate the land and waterways, causing a second wave of pollution. Toxic metals that can cause kidney damage and cancers, as well as gastric and intestinal issues, could be carried downstream to the capital, Lusaka, says Dr Mweene Himwiinga, a senior lecturer at Zambia's Copperbelt University. The Chinese embassy in Lusaka disputes the scale of the damage and told the BBC it welcomed the establishment of an independent investigation into the incident. The Zambian government, it said, had reported that the pollution was contained to a confined area, water acidity levels had returned to normal limits and that ongoing checks showed no lasting public-health risks. Lamec, like his country Zambia, finds himself in a difficult position. The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse. More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment. In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households. They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement. The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories. ""All eyes are on this case,"" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. ""Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved."" People found it hard to believe at first ""because something of this scale had not happened before,"" he adds. The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining. Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China. But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba. ""There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,"" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. ""We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue."" Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese. Between 2000 and 2023, 49 African countries are believed to have signed $182.3bn (£139.4bn) worth of loans with Chinese lenders. In Copperbelt Province, Lamec tells us he was really broken by the spill affecting his family. ""We were told that the waterways now had acid in them, and that we were not supposed to use the water."" For two weeks after the spill, Lamec says he and his family weren't allowed to use the local water until it had been sprayed with lime to help reduce the acidity. He took the job at the dam because, he says, he has no other way to make a living, but now feels conflicted about working there. Copper mining has been the economic backbone of this region for more than a century. The metal makes up 70% of Zambia's exports and accounts for 15% of its GDP. The industry is set to grow further, with plans to more than triple production in Zambia by 2031, according to plans laid out by the government last year. In the village of Twalima, it has been a struggle to grow anything since the spill, say farmers Abigail Namtowe, 28, and Frederick Bwalya, 72. Farming was the main source of food and income for Ms Namtowe's family, and her six year-old daughter is now very hungry and malnourished, she told us. ""I've tried to grow my maize, I've tried everything so the hunger won't kill my child, but it's too much."" Mr Bwalya has lived in Twalima for 33 years. Strong and energetic, we meet him working on his farm which he tends to daily. ""Farming is not going well because the soil is not clean,"" he says. He also describes a severe pain in his leg which won't go away and makes it difficult for him to move. ""The doctor says the contaminated water could be causing this,"" he adds. Sino Metals has promised to build a borehole away from the contaminated stream at the bottom of his farm, he says, but that hasn't happened yet. He believes that water deeper underground would be safer. The stream used to be teeming with fish, say Mr Bwalya and his neighbours, adding that since the spill, there haven't been any. The BBC asked Sino Metals about the alleged promise to build boreholes on the land of affected farmers. We also put Lamec's allegations that he does not feel safe working at the company, but the firm did not respond. Fifty kilometres (31 miles) away from Frederick Bwalya's village, in Kamwatimpa, we saw schoolchildren swimming in a tributary of the Kafue river. Some mothers - still worried about the pollution - said they had told their children not to go into the water. But the government says it sampled 21 sites across Copperbelt Province in September, and that the concentrations of heavy metals were within national safe limits. Now the rainy season has taken hold, the power to stop a second wave of pollution seeping into the soil, and carrying heavy metals down the river to the rest of the country, is in the hands of the government and Sino Metals. The clean-up has been delayed by issues between the consultants hired to assess the damage and Sino Metals, Dr Chibamba told the BBC, when asked why some of this work hadn't been done earlier. Meanwhile, Dr Himwiinga warns that failure to deal with the situation ""may be catastrophic"". ""They [the heavy metals] could be there for years, and their effects could be felt for a very long period of time, by farmers... who rely on that water to irrigate their crops,"" she says. ""According to research carried out by Copperbelt University, this could go on for even over 10 years, unless remediation efforts are put in place."" The Zambian government says it is aware of this and has instructed Sino Metals to put mitigations in place to stop secondary pollution - including planting trees, to bring down levels of pollution in the air and soil, as well as spreading lime to reduce acidity. These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities. Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment. Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company. One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments. But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries. ""The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,"" says Prof Chan. ""The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans."" Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa. African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says. ""It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world."" African governments are ""not always getting it right"", he says, however ""this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make."" For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was ""grossly unfair"" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial. ""Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,"" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says. ""It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa."""
China US,Starmer says China policy cannot continue to blow 'hot and cold',2025-12-01T21:21:40.106Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w7xenlnp1o,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says UK government policy towards China cannot continue to blow ""hot and cold"". Speaking at the annual Lady Mayor's banquet, traditionally used to set out foreign policy for the year ahead, Sir Keir told guests his government will focus on the relationship with China. The speech follows an targeting MPs and parliamentary staff, and comes less than a fortnight before a decision on whether in the capital despite security concerns. The prime minister stressed that being tough on national security will enable the UK to pursue economic opportunities with the world's second biggest economy. Sir Keir's speech in the City of London rejected the ""isolationism"" put forward by opponents of the Chinese government, notably former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who say the state should be treated as an enemy. However, failing to navigate a relationship with China would be ""a dereliction of duty"", the prime minister said, when China is a ""defining force in technology, trade and global governance"". Building a careful relationship would instead bolster the UK's place as a leader on the international stage and help secure UK national interests, he said, while still recognising the ""reality"" that China ""poses national security threats"". ""Instead, for years we have blown hot and cold,"" he said. ""We had the golden age, which then flipped to an Ice Age. We reject that binary choice. ""So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism."" Those security threats were clearly outlined earlier this month, when security services took the unusual step of issuing a warning that specifically identified . The alert explained the profiles were being used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), acting as ""civilian recruitment headhunters"" to target individuals working in British politics ""at scale"", including economists and think tank employees as well as people in Parliament. A Chinese Embassy spokesperson denied the accusations of espionage and said they were ""pure fabrication"" that were ""undermining China-UK relations"". , which would be the biggest in Europe, sitting on a site at Royal Mint Court, which is close to the City of London and fibre optic cables carrying vast quantities of highly sensitive data. Housing Secretary Steve Reed has the final say and is expected to give the green light to the plans, following consultation with MI5 and MI6, in a decision opposed by Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. At the speech in London's Guildhall, Sir Keir insisted there would not be any ""trade-off"" between security and economic access with China, appearing to rule out trade on areas of defence, AI or critical national infrastructure. ""Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty,"" he said. ""But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas."" These areas would include financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals and luxury goods, he said, adding they were: ""Great British success stories –  the export opportunities are huge and we will back you to seize them."" to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

China US,Louvre to hike ticket prices for most non-EU tourists by 45%,2025-11-28T08:59:32.121Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd4llgrego,"Ticket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday. From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery. The museum's security and management have faced criticism since , when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes. An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure. From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum. Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC. The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added. The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum. There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026. Macron also said the to deal with overcrowding. Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo. The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros. Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics . The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration."
China US,Shein and Temu face calls for investigation over claims of stealing US designs,2025-12-02T09:52:28.694Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lvzeyk21vo,"Online retailers Shein and Temu are facing increased pressure in the US after two senior politicians pushed for investigations, including into claims of forced labour and intellectual property (IP) theft. In Texas, the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a probe into allegations of forced labour and the use of unsafe materials at Shein. At a national level, Senator Tom Cotton called for a federal investigation into possible IP theft at both Shein and Temu, which he labelled ""Communist Chinese"" platforms. Shein said it took concerns raised about its business practices seriously. Temu did not immediately respond for comment. Shein said in a statement that it would co-operate with the investigation and that it welcomed ""constructive engagement"" with Paxton. It said in response to Cotton's letter that the company continues to invest in protecting the rights of designers worldwide. ""We are constantly improving our internal processes to better protect creators,"" said Shein. The retailer is headquartered in Singapore but most of the goods sold on its platform are made in China, where it was founded. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, Cotton - senior Republican from Arkansas - said that millions of packages from China now sit in US warehouses after Washington changed its rules on low-cost shipments in August. , a global tariff exemption widely used by buyers of low-cost goods. The change subjected shipments to levies and stricter customs checks. The new regulations gives the Department of Justice and Homeland Security a ""golden opportunity"" to act, said Cotton, a key ally of Trump and a vocal critic of China. Designers and small American brands have accused Shein of systematically copying their original creations, often just days after launch, and selling them at a fraction of the price, he said. Cotton also accused Temu of carrying ""sophisticated and deceptive fakes"" on its platform, which has hundreds of millions of users. Cotton cited a which found a significant proportion of items that its researchers bought on Shein and Temu were likely counterfeits. Separately, Paxton from Texas said that numerous reports have raised serious concerns about Shein's alleged reliance on forced labour, and claims of the use of unsafe materials and deceptive marketing. The brand has been under scrutiny over the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business and the on its site. The Republican lawyer said the investigation will assess if Shein's practices violate Texas law by allegedly using hazardous materials and if it has misled consumers about ethical sourcing. The probe will also examine Shein's data collection practices, he added. ""I will not allow cheap, dangerous, foreign goods to flood America and jeopardise our health,"" said Paxton online. Shein also faces calls by the European Union to curb sales of childlike sex dolls and weapons on its third-party marketplace place after . Temu is also being investigated in France over the spread of harmful content accessible to young people. Shein is not the only firm under fire by Paxton, who, like Cotton, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. He and deceiving parents about the dangers that the platform is said to pose to young gamers. Roblox has denied the claims, which it said are based on ""misrepresentations"" of its online gaming platform."
China US,What we know about the Hong Kong apartment fires,2025-11-28T09:47:59.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxe9r7wjgro,"Hong Kong's deadliest fire in more than 60 years ripped through a high-rise public housing complex in the city's north-east this week, killing at least 128 people. Dozens more remain missing, with 79 people confirmed injured and and 89 bodies yet to be identified. Now, as the last flames are extinguished and the high-rise blocks smoulder against the city's urban skyline, attention has turned to the cause of the deadly fire, and the factors that allowed it to so rapidly spread. Many Hong Kongers have described it as a ""man-made disaster"". Authorities have attributed the ferocity of the blaze to Styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks - while also noting that fire alarms in all eight housing blocks were found to be not working effectively. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire, according to local media reports, and an investigation has been launched. What initially caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far. The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT). Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, each 31 storeys high. Seven have been affected by the fire, Tai Po district councillor Mui Siu-fung told BBC Chinese. Built in 1983, the tower blocks were undergoing renovations when the fire broke out. Tai Po is a residential district in the northern part of Hong Kong, near the city of Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland. The complex provides 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of the people who lived in the Wang Fuk Court housing complex are at least 65, or older, according to the latest census. Some of them have lived in the subsidised public housing estate since it was built. The cause of the fire is unknown, but Hong Kong Security Chief Tang Ping-Keung on Friday attributed its rapid spread to styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks. A preliminary investigation previously found that the blaze had escalated unusually fast, and police had revealed that a mesh material and plastic sheets - both of which are believed to not be fireproof - was found on the outside of the buildings. Police have arrested three men aged between 52 and 68 on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the deadly blaze. Two of them are directors of a construction firm while the other is an engineering consultant. A police spokesperson on Thursday said investigators were looking into the alleged actions, or failure to act, of the firm's top officials. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" said the spokesperson. Authorities on Friday further noted that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working effectively - confirming prior reports from some residents who said they did not sound when the blaze broke out. This was Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years. Within 40 minutes of first being reported it was declared a level four alarm - but it was raised to a level five, the highest in severity, about three and a half hours later. Local media had earlier reported that explosions could be heard inside the building and fire hoses could not easily reach the higher levels. The ferocity of the heat had prevented firefighters from entering the buildings. Officials told reporters on Friday that even after the fire had been put out, some sections of the buildings' remained above 200C (392F). The city's fire department on Thursday said that the combination of high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments made rescue operations difficult Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have an average living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out. Hundreds were evacuated to temporary shelters, and some were allocated emergency housing units. More than 2,311 firefighters took part in rescue operations, with 12 sustaining injuries during the response. Authorities said 391 fire engines were also mobilised and 188 ambulances dispatched. Among the dead is firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, who was with the service at Sha Tin Fire Station for nine years. The fire service says it lost contact with him at 15:30 local time, and about half an hour later, found that he had collapsed. He was taken to hospital but declared dead shortly after. ""I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,"" said Andy Yeung, director of the fire service. One resident, Mr Chung, told the BBC he got a panicked phone call on Wednesday afternoon from his wife saying she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Mr Chung said he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. to accommodate residents who were evacuated, the government said. The South China Morning Post reported that one of them - at Tung Cheong Street Sports Centre - was full, and residents were being directed to other shelters. Another, the Kwong Fuk Community Hall, which is just over the road from the housing estate, was deemed unsafe. Evacuees were moved to another shelter, further away. BBC Chinese reporter Gemini Cheng saw elderly residents, some using walking sticks or wheelchairs, arriving at some of the shelters. At least 900 people are taking shelter in such temporary facilities, news agency AFP reports, quoting Lee. Six schools in Tai Po will remain closed on Thursday, the Education Bureau announced, . An emergency monitoring and support centre is in operation to manage the impact of the fire, security secretary Tang Ping-keung said in a statement. A hotline for the public to ask about casualties has been set up by Hong Kong police. The tower blocks at Wang Fuk Court are covered in bamboo scaffolding and green construction netting, right up to the rooftops, because they are undergoing renovations. As mentioned earlier, authorities have attributed the quick spread of the fire to materials used in the renovation, such as mesh netting, plastic sheeting and styrofoam. It's still unclear how the fire began, but no matter its cause, proper netting on the buildings' exterior would have been key to preventing its spread, Jason Poon, chairman of construction NGO Chinat Monitor, told news outlet Initium Media. Substandard netting could cause the fire to spread rapidly, he added. Another engineer told Initium Media he believes that the vast majority of mesh netting used in construction across Hong Kong is not made of fire-retardant material. Cardboard, debris and paint thinner is also often found on the scaffolding, which along with dry weather could hasten the spread of fire, the engineer said. One fire safety expert the BBC spoke to said the bamboo scaffolding - a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. Authorities have not mentioned scaffolding as having caused or fuelled the rapid spread of the fire. Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong, although reports said these were caused by falls and other safety failures, rather than fires. Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were ""relatively old"" - they were built in the 1980s - so ""the glass windows are not that fire resilient"". ""The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane... [which makes it] very easy to be broken by the flames and the flames can then penetrate through the facade."""
China US,Dutch government suspends intervention into chipmaker Nexperia,2025-11-19T15:53:52.309Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p7j83rn1o,"The Dutch government has suspended its intervention at Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, following talks with China. The Hague over ""serious governance shortcomings"" and concerns over the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods. In response, Beijing blocked exports of the firm's chips. However, on Wednesday the Dutch government said it would halt its original decision following ""constructive talks"" with Beijing. China said it welcomed the move, adding it was a ""first step in the right direction towards a proper resolution"". Nexperia is a major supplier of basic computer chips to the car industry, and shortages have threatened global supply chains. A shortage of computer chips used in various electronic goods and cars would hugely impact the ability of manufacturers to make their products. The decision by the Dutch government will ease tensions between the European Union and China, which have been mounting in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. Vincent Karremans, economic affairs minister, said that he considered it right to suspend action, made under the Goods Availability Act, ahead of further talks with the Chinese government. ""We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement. The Dutch government said it originally invoked the Act following concerns ""from actions attributed to the now-suspended CEO, involving the improper transfer of product assets, funds, technology, and knowledge to a foreign entity"". ""These actions ran counter to the interests of the company, its shareholders, and Dutch and European strategic autonomy and security of supply,"" it said. In October, a Dutch court ordered the removal of ex-Nexperia CEO and Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng, citing alleged mismanagement. The Dutch government added that its decision had aimed to prevent a situation in which chips could become unavailable in an emergency. In December last year, the US government placed Wingtech, which owns Nexperia, on its so-called ""entity list"", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. Following the Dutch government's reversal, the Beijing acknowledged the move but said it was ""still a step away from addressing the root cause of the global semiconductor supply chain turmoil and chaos"". ""Furthermore, the erroneous ruling by the corporate court, spearheaded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, to strip Wingtech of its control over Nexperia remains a key obstacle to resolving the issue,"" it added. Wingtech has said it will fight the decision. Following the latest move, a spokesperson for Wingtch said the company ""strongly"" rejected the allegations against its chief executive. ""To date, no proof has been provided,"" it added. ""If the Dutch government is sincere about solving the problem, the Ministry should now file a letter with the Enterprise Chamber, explicitly withdrawing its support for the proceedings. ""These proceedings form a threat to the continuity of Nexperia B.V. and therefore for the economic security of the Netherlands and Europe - which is the exact same argument the Dutch government made previously in support of judicial intervention."""
China US,Aardman to celebrate 50 'cracking' years in home city,2025-12-02T15:54:45.446Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv34344y4o,"The animation studio behind Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run and Shaun the Sheep is celebrating 50 years in the business with a major new exhibition in its home city. Bristol-based Aardman Studios, famed for its stop-motion and clay modelling animation, was founded by school friends David Sproxton and Peter Lord. The ""Cracking Exhibition Gromit: 50 Years of Aardman in Bristol"" is due to take over the M Shed next summer, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, iconic characters and a celebration of the studio's ""deep-rooted connection"" to the city Ngaio Harding-Hill, from Aardman, said: ""2026 is such an important year for Aardman and the anniversary would never have been complete without a celebration in our home city."" ""The programme of experiences with M Shed and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery will be a real highlight celebrating the importance of Bristol, its people and creative connection to the studio over the last 50 years,"" he added. As part of the collaboration, ""Aardman treasures"" will also be hidden throughout Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Bristol Museums head of culture, Philip Walker, said they were ""absolutely delighted"" to be working with Aardman on this exciting collaboration. ""It's a brilliant celebration of Bristol's creative spirit and a tribute to the imagination and humour that Aardman has shared with the world for half a century,"" he said. ""We can't wait to showcase 50 years of clay, creativity, and cracking adventures."" The first Wallace And Gromit film was 1989's A Grand Day Out, which was followed by The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit and A Matter Of Loaf And Death. The studio's most recent film Vengeance Most Fowl, which saw the return of evil penguin Feathers McGraw, picked up two gongs at the Baftas awards ceremony and was also nominated for an Oscar."
China US,'I am devastated': Hong Kong residents in disbelief after fire destroys blocks of flats,2025-11-27T15:03:14.208Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjnlx1g6yo,"""When you get closer the heat rises and you can feel it and the smoke is really heavy."" Student Thomas Liu was one of many people drawn to the scene of a deadly fire that tore through much of the eight-block Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district. At least 83 people have died so far in the devastating blaze that began on Wednesday, and with hundreds still missing, this number is expected to rise. The cause is not yet known, but three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to flammable materials, including mesh and plastic sheets, that may have allowed the fire to spread quickly. ""It's a disaster,"" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. ""Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,"" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. The fire was gradually being contained but officials said they did not know when it would be fully extinguished. Flames could be seen coming from individual apartments as many people watched on in silence. One woman said her friends live inside the building and she was waiting to hear if they managed to get out. Harry Cheung, who has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for more than 40 years, told Reuters he heard ""a very loud noise"" and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. ""I immediately went back to pack up my things,"" the 66-year-old resident said. ""I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight because I probably won't be able to go back home."" A woman in her sixties, whose surname is Kam and who lives in the adjacent Kwong Fuk Estate, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that several of her friends living in Wang Fuk Court had been accounted for - but not all. One friend has daily afternoon naps and may have been sleeping when the fire broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT), Ms Kam said, adding that the woman's daughters have not yet been able to contact her. Another resident, 65-year-old Jason Kong, told Reuters that a neighbour called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. ""I am devastated. There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do. I hope the government can help us to settle down after this."" An elderly woman who lives in one of the affected blocks told the BBC she was not at home when the fire broke out but that she was worried about her apartment because it was not insured. ""I'm very upset that I have no home to go to now,"" she said. While the cause of the fire that engulfed the multiple high-rise blocks was unknown, police say a mesh material and plastic sheets were found outside the buildings - both of which are not believed to be fireproof. Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows. These materials may have caused the fire to spread more quickly, said police. Some people have expressed anger that such a massive fire could have happened and criticised the response. ""When there's a wildfire, they will deploy helicopters and drop water bombs, but why is there no such deployment and how can they leave other buildings burning?"" Ms Poon, another resident of Wang Fuk Court, who is in her sixties, asked. ""The community is so close to the fire station and we thought the fire could be put out soon, but now the fire has spread. I'm so disappointed,"" she told the SCMP. Ms Poon noted that she had been given no instructions from the government on where to seek help. The BBC spoke to some Tai Po residents who had brought supplies to the victims and affected residents - including dozens of blankets and heat packs. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said government departments were assisting residents affected by the fire. When asked about their feelings about the fire, the residents said ""the government is incompetent"" and that they were ""immensely heartbroken"". ""We don't want to see any more casualties,"" said one."
China US,COP30: Five key takeaways from a deeply divisive climate summit ,2025-11-23T00:10:18.355Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp84m16mdm1o,"In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive. Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated. The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change. Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the ""COP of truth"". The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted. And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting. Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible. So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP. The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations. Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that. While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return. Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas. To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion. It made matters worse. Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy. The EU were given short shrift by major producers. ""We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,"" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer. Ouch! Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse. Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP. These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain. They are the richest group of nations still in the but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour. While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of. The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft. The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the ""tripling"" word stayed in the text. So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in. ""Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,"" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics. ""This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union."" The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front. The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself. Two often heard positions: How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words? How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks? The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore. ""We can't discard it entirely,"" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News. ""But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far."" Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people. It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore. Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an ""implementation cop"" and put a lot of focus on the ""energy agenda"". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant. COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance. For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an ""orchestrated"" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G. 'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking. The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it. They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - ""unilateral"" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive. The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad. If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves. Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials. The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization. The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways. US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here. Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals. And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels. ""China kept a low political profile,"" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society. ""And they focussed on making money in the real world.""

China US,Strange pillar of light linked to Chinese rocket,2025-12-06T12:02:15.539Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98ze8jx7o,"A glowing streak spotted in the sky on Thursday morning was most likely caused by a Chinese rocket, experts say. Witnesses reported a bright, linear trail visible around dawn and dusk from several locations. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the US, said: ""It was definitely the Chinese Zhuque-3 rocket making its first test flight. ""It passed over the UK and northern Europe at around 05:00 GMT at the end of its first orbit, following launch from China at 04:02 GMT. Chinese upper stages have been previously observed to make long, linear propellant-dump trails."" Ellie Jarvis, from Clovelly, said: ""I've never seen anything like it. At first, I wondered whether it might be something like an aurora or a natural phenomenon - like a light pillar. ""I tried to see whether there was something shining a beam of light from across the bay, or perhaps from a ship - but that didn't  seem likely as the light seemed to be so high in the sky."" A jet contrail was also considered but dismissed because the trail appeared too widespread. Similar vertical light effects, known as light pillars, can sometimes form when high-altitude ice crystals reflect low-angle sunlight, creating unusual atmospheric displays."
China US,Sixth-tier club contemplates second doc series,2025-11-23T12:32:40.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx5j096pxo,"A sixth-tier football club's owner says he is ""very close now to agreeing on series two"" of a documentary about his Sussex team. Eastbourne Borough Football Club has released the seven-episode Owning Eastbourne series on its YouTube channel. Cameras followed the club through the 2024-25 season, when the team lost in the National League South play-off semi-finals to Maidstone United. The club's owner Simon Leslie claims the first series of the documentary has ""had some really good interest"" from broadcasters since its release. It was broadcast on ReachTV, a channel shown in US airports, and the club is close to a deal to show the programme in China, according to Mr Leslie. The club owner told the BBC the documentary ""gives us an opportunity to share with people who want to get involved in what we're doing"". ""It's a very expensive business owning a football club,"" he said. ""I've had very broad shoulders for nearly three years and I need people to come in and support me, and help me, and be part of this journey."" He said viewers get ""a full, unfiltered view of behind the scenes, in the changing room, in the boardroom of what it's like in non-league football"". ""What's been really great over the last couple days is some of the comments have been incredibly positive,"" Mr Leslie said. ""There have been some less so comments as well, but it is like nothing else."" So far this season, Eastbourne have struggled in the National League South and currently find themselves in the relegation zone. Matt Gray, who was appointed in the summer, was sacked by the club in October and replaced by Tommy Widdrington for his second spell as manager of the club. Mr Leslie said the season so far had been ""a rollercoaster arc of emotions"" but he felt the team was ""on the up""."
China US,Mum and baby fire plea sent to woman in Manchester,2025-11-28T19:08:29.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0nld5v87zo,"A woman in Manchester said she received pleas for help from a mum who was stuck in a Hong Kong flat fire with her newborn baby. At least after the and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. The cause of the fire remains unclear though officials said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread. Cherry moved to Manchester three years ago but she grew up in the complex and is still on a residents' group chat where she saw the pleas for help. Cherry said she did not sleep on Wednesday night. ""I felt really really sad because I knew I couldn't do anything,"" she said. ""I was seeing messages from people still in the fire asking for help, pleading to be saved. ""What I most strongly remember was a mother - she was in the fire with her three-month-old baby, messaging for help. She told us the address and said 'please help to save us'. ""A lot of people downstairs were writing support to her, telling her how to keep stable and calm until the firemen came."" Cherry told Radio Manchester that the mother and baby were rescued and were safe and well. ""They are in hospital for monitoring,"" she said. But Cherry said they were not the only residents who were trapped like this. Cherry said she believed ongoing maintenance work, flammable materials and a lack of working fire alarms were responsible for the scale of the tragedy. ""There is green mesh outside the building because of the maintenance work,"" she said. ""However in Hong Kong there is no understanding that this mesh needed to be fire resistant. ""The residents say they have tested the mesh nets and found out that the material was not fire resistant and they are angry. ""They are thinking about how they pay so much money but didn't get what they needed, didn't get anything to protect their lives."" Authorities are investigating the incident. ""It is too late now,"" said Cherry. ""I think what we should be doing is looking at how to prevent this happening again for a second time,"" she added. on suspicion of corruption over the renovation work at the complex. Three others were also detained earlier on manslaughter charges."
China US,"Graduate jobs under threat from AI, PwC boss says",2025-11-21T02:34:57.601Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm272510e6jo,"The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) may eventually lead to fewer entry-level graduates being hired, the boss of accountancy giant PwC has told the BBC. However, global chairman Mohamed Kande said AI was not behind recent job cuts at the firm, adding that the company actually needed to hire hundreds of new AI engineers but was struggling to find them. But some observers say the technology itself threatens thousands of junior jobs across the professional services industry. Speaking on the sidelines of a business summit in Singapore, Mr Kande also said big changes in the global economy, such as US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, had been good for the firm's consulting business. He also addressed the company's suspension in China last year over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande, promising that the same mistakes ""would not happen again"". Headquartered in London, PwC is one of the Big Four accountancy firms. It provides a range of services, such as financial auditing, consulting and tax advice for business clients around the world. According to Mr Kande, advising them on how to integrate AI into their operations will be at the heart of the firm's future business strategy, even as the rapidly advancing technology affects its own hiring plans. Firms who would have previously hired PwC consultants to sift through data and documents may now use AI models instead, turning weeks of costly work into mere minutes. Every year, the company hires thousands of new graduates in entry-level positions - including 1,300 in the UK and 3,200 in the US last year - but it recently dropped long-term plans to continue increasing its headcount. In 2021, PwC said it wanted to hire 100,000 people over the course of five years - but Mr Kande said this would no longer be possible. ""When we made the plans to hire that many people, the world looked very, very different,"" he said. ""Now we have artificial intelligence. We want to hire, but I don't know if it's going to be the same level of people that we hire - it will be a different set of people."" Last year, PwC cut more than 5,600 roles across its worldwide operation. The boss of the company's UK business has previously spoken about reducing graduate recruitment, admitting that AI was ""certainly reshaping roles"". At a global level, however, Mr Kande insisted that the AI boom was an ""exciting time"" for creating new jobs. ""We are looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers today to help us drive our AI agenda, but we just cannot find them,"" he said. Businesses around the world may be facing challenges adapting to AI, but in the meantime PwC appears to have benefited from the broader uncertainty in the global economy, largely fuelled by President Trump's extensive use of tariffs. ""We are receiving a lot of calls from many companies around the world asking how to navigate the current environment,"" said Mr Kande. ""It's been good for us. We need to remain relevant to our clients and we have to be in these discussions, which we are."" However, the company took a huge reputational blow last year, when over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande. The firm went bust after amassing debts of more than $300bn (£230bn) and has been at the centre of a ruinous housing crisis that continues to damage lives and livelihoods in China. The country's Securities Regulatory Commission found that PwC, as the auditor, had ""covered up and even condoned"" financial fraud at Evergrande. Mr Kande, whose tenure as global chairman began after Evergrande went bankrupt, said PwC no longer faced any restrictions in China. ""Let me tell you - we changed many of our people, implemented new quality management systems and introduced new governance systems,"" he said. ""My focus has been to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."""
China US,Cats became our companions much later than you think,2025-11-27T20:02:21.954Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8dvdp9gn7o,"In true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place. A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. ""They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,"" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford. ""That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago."" All modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat. How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists. To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats. The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa. ""Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,"" said Prof Larson. This fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies. Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought. They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China. Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica. And in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene. These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years. The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially ""commensal"" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. ""Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,"" she said. Leopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia. Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s. The research is published in the journal, and in ."
China US,'Hang in there': Agonising wait for the missing after Hong Kong blaze,2025-11-28T07:11:58.245Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9y0pjzmdro,"""Hang in there."" Those were the last words Mr Chung said to his wife after a huge 's Tai Po district. It was around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday when he got her panicked phone call. She said she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Firefighters in the Chinese territory took nearly 24 hours to tame the blaze that tore through seven tower blocks, including theirs, claiming at least 128 lives so far. Nearly 300 people are still unaccounted for - Mr Chung's wife is among the many missing. The BBC spoke to several residents who were not at home or managed to escape in time. Some, like Mr Chung, have waited outside the burning buildings, hoping against hope. There was no alarm warning them of danger, all of them told the BBC. Mr Chung, 45, and his brother, spent Wednesday night on the street asking the firefighters dozens of times for updates - but they couldn't give them any. Throughout, he said, he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. The Chungs moved in a decade ago to Wang Cheong House – the first of the seven tower blocks at Tai Po to go up in flames. When the fire started, Mr Chung says, the smoke on the 23rd floor, where they lived, turned so thick within just 10 minutes, that his wife couldn't find her way out. The cause of the fire is still unclear, but authorities believe renovations using flammable material and scaffolding helped spread what has now become the deadliest blaze in Hong Kong in six decades. It engulfed seven of the eight buildings - comprising 1,800 units - in Wang Fuk Court, a subsidised housing estate built in 1983 to the north of Hong Kong Island, where the city's wealthy live. Nearly 40% of Wang Fuk Court's residents are aged 65 or above, according to the 2021 census. It's partly why it's feared so many residents were trapped - because they are older and less likely to have made it out quickly. Ms Fung, 40, has not been able to find her mother yet. She and her parents moved to the estate only last year - for its views of the ocean. Her father and she were at work when the fire started. Ms Fung received a call from her neighbour, who said she was hiding with Ms Fung's mother inside a toilet. But they lost contact at midnight on Wednesday. All the same, she is holding on to hope: ""We will think about our next steps after my mum comes out."" She sought help from police, but she says she was furious when they called her back to ask if it was possible her mother could have somehow escaped. She demanded to know how that was possible: ""You know much better than us how badly burnt Wang Cheong House is!"" On social media, posts about missing elderly relatives, children and pets have been circulating endlessly. A desperate mother wrote: ""I still can't find my baby girl. It's nearly 30 hours and there has been no updates from the fire service…"" In a later post, she said: ""I am afraid there is no hope."" The devastation has spotlighted the expensive and controversial renovations at Wang Fuk Court, which cost about HK$330M ($42.2M; £32.1M), with each household having to pay between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000. Many residents had opposed the project because of the costs but it went ahead. Authorities have now arrested three executives from the construction firm, citing ""gross negligence"".  Police say the mesh and plastic sheets used on the scaffolding were substandard, and that windows were wrapped in highly flammable styrofoam. Grandma Chan, a long-time resident, says she had been scared since the renovation began last year, because of its scale and she had occasionally noticed a burning smell. ""Will anything happen if I stay home?"" she once asked her daughter. The 72-year-old was alone at home when the fire started but she only found out about it when her daughter, who was travelling in South Korea, called. She says she made it out alive because her daughter told her to flee. It was the same for 82-year-old Grandma Wu. When the fire broke out, she was playing mahjong, a popular game, with her neighbours. They were warned not by an alarm, but by their husbands calling them. But she said they continued the game because there were three buildings between theirs and Wang Cheong House, where the fire broke out. Then came a second call, saying the fire had reached their building. The women immediately took the lift and reached the ground floor. Surrounded by the smell of burning buildings, Grandma Wu looked up to find that seven of eight buildings within the complex were in flames. Although she was safe, she stayed outside, with her helper, overnight. She says her son wanted to take her to his home but she refused. ""I have been living in this flat for 42 years,"" she says. ""I told my son not to come, and I would not go anywhere. I have to sit here and watch how this goes. My heart will only be at peace after the fire is extinguished."" When that happens, a new battle begins for many residents who have poured a life's worth of savings into buying these homes. Kyle Ho, 32, moved into the complex with his retired parents three years ago. Despite the subsidised price, they needed a mortgage to afford a home at Wang Fuk Court. Now, they don't know what comes next. The Hong Kong government has announced cash relief of HK$10,000 for displaced families, and a HK$300m assistance fund. That could be some relief for Mr Ho. ""The worst-case scenario is that we have lost our flat,"" he says. ""But the most important thing is that all of us are safe. We are luckier than many other families."" For those like Mr Chung, the wait continues as authorities insist they have not ruled out rescuing people. ""We haven't given up,"" they said earlier on Thursday. Mr Chung, too, is determined to find his wife. ""I want to rescue her - whether she's alive or gone."""
China US,Gardeners unearth stolen phones left by snatchers,2025-11-25T06:00:33.440Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vm6p3vjd2o,"Volunteers at a community garden in central London have been reuniting phone theft victims with their stolen devices after finding them buried in flower-beds. The Phoenix Garden, off Shaftesbury Avenue in Covent Garden, has seen snatchers stash stolen phones in its grounds due to its proximity to the West End, in an issue first reported by . Garden volunteers said they collected the phones from bushes and flower-beds and handed them to their owners or the police. As a result, fewer devices have been unearthed in recent weeks. Louise Gates, Phoenix Garden manager, said she often found phones ""thrown over the fence from the night before"" when she unlocked the garden in the morning. ""Some of our volunteers have dug up phones wrapped in tin foil,"" Ms Gates added. Tinfoil is often used by phone snatchers to stop the device's location being detected. It is believed that snatchers, often on electric bikes around hotspot areas like Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, have been temporarily stashing the phones in the garden for collection at a later date. Ms Gates said some of the theft victims had arrived at the garden after tracking their device's signal through Apple's Find My app. Ms Gates said if she could find the emergency contact information on the phone, she called the number provided. ""They're all really so grateful, which is nice,"" she said. ""Other times I charge it up, but nobody rings, I don't know who it belongs to or I can't find them on social media, so I just take it to the police station."" Ron Chenery, a volunteer of two years, said finding phones was a regular occurrence. ""Most of us love the garden so much, we're constantly out in the fresh air. If we see something we hand it in,"" he said. Community worker Elliot Hughes, who helps local students access the garden and get into nature, said it was important to teach young people about the wider risks of phone theft across the capital. ""The best we can do is give awareness"" he said. ""There's young people now, walking around central London on their phones, in the middle of the street, which are essentially £1,000 computers. ""So [I am] just highlighting to them maybe the things they shouldn't be doing."" A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said local officers had stepped up patrols in the area to identify potential phone snatching offenders. ""By intensifying our efforts we're catching more perpetrators and protecting people from having their phone stolen in the capital and have reduced theft by 16% since April. ""We're also dismantling organised crime groups suspected of large-scale phone theft."" The force called on phone companies including Apple and Samsung for security improvements that would make stolen phones harder to sell."
China US,Meta accused of letting AI sellers 'run rampant',2025-11-29T07:01:17.149Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz90d4q0o,"Facebook owner Meta has been accused of allowing misleading companies to ""run rampant"" on its platforms, as dozens of people say they have fallen victim to sellers using AI-generated adverts. More than 60 people contacted the BBC after we revealed unscrupulous foreign firms were . Some said they had been targeted by ads on Facebook and Instagram, and consumer guide Which? said businesses were using the platforms to ""spread their lies furthest and widest"". Meta said it had removed content by six companies, flagged by the BBC, which claimed to be based in England but were shipping cheap goods in from Asia. The tech giant said it did not allow fraudulent activity and worked closely with Stop Scams UK to protect users. One company removed from the platform is C'est La Vie, but had a returns address in China. Mabel & Daisy, which used AI generated pictures of a mother and daughter and claimed to sell ""timeless clothing"" from a shop in Bristol, has also been removed from the platform after it was exposed for selling cheap items from a base in Hong Kong. Other companies Meta says it is taking action against are clothing firms Sylvia & Grace, Chester & Claire, Harrison & Hayes and Olyndra London, as well as accessories business Omelia & Oliver Jewels. All have one-star reviews on Trustpilot with hundreds of customers saying they were duped into thinking they were buying from UK-based brands and received shoddy goods. Harrison & Hayes claimed to be a Manchester-based independent clothes shop with ""decades of experience"" but has a returns address to a central warehouse in China. It has used an AI-image of a shop front in the city which does not exist. Chester & Clare also uses an AI-generated image of a shopfront to market its business, which it claims has operated in London since 2005 but is actually based in the Netherlands and sells clothes shipped from China. Its terms of service states imagery, stories, characters and boutique locations ""may have been created using generate AI"" to ""enhance customer experience"". The BBC contacted all businesses but only got automated responses. Claire Brown was persuaded to buy two dresses for £73 from Luxe and Luna London, after ""constantly"" seeing the company's appealing adverts on Facebook. When the dresses arrived weeks later they were poorly made of flimsy material and ""looked awful"". ""It felt like a trusted brand after I'd seen it on Facebook so much, you see all these clothing collections and I liked what I saw,"" she said. Ms Brown, who works in tech marketing, said she reported the company to Meta but never got a response. The company has now stopped operating, with stating life had ""taken a devastating turn"" because of the death of a partner, an almost identical statement used by fake Birmingham jewellery business C'est La Vie. ""It makes me feel really cross, because I hate people being scammed and the websites are the kind of thing you would share with a friend,"" Claire added. ""There is a real lack of protection here for consumers."" Another Facebook user, Stuart, said he had reported a number of suspicious companies to the platform but was advised to ""influence the ads that you see by hiding ads and changing your ad preferences"" in its response. No other action was taken. Some of the fraudulent companies discovered by the BBC appear to be . That's where a third-party buys products from a wholesaler and sells them with a significant mark-up, having never seen the product themselves. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) recently that used images of roses, cobbled streets and the union jack when it was shipping goods from a warehouse in Asia. The regulator said it was continuing to take action on misleading adverts but said platforms like Facebook played an ""important role"" in maintaining ""responsible advertising"" and continued to engage with them on how best to prevent those that break the rules. Which? said Meta had allowed fake companies to ""run rampant on its platforms for too long"" and said it should be doing ""much more"" to stop scams and protect its users. Meta said it wanted users to report suspicious adverts on its platforms, which was an ""important signal"" to its review systems and could prompt a re-review of the advert while improving policies."
China US,Trump's plan for Gaza backed by UN Security Council,2025-11-18T02:03:30.771Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpkgq4wllo,"The UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza. Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained. Adopting it was an ""important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire"", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan ""imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject"". ""Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,"" it added. Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas. Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be ""tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians"". The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force. Trump called the Security Council vote ""historic"" and said it was a way of ""acknowledging and endorsing"" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. ""This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for. Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text. The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to ""translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground"" and lead to ""a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution"". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution. The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented ""urgently and immediately"". Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it. Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution. The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a ""fragile, fragile first step"". Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack. More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
China US,"Britain won't beat the US in AI race, says ex-Google scientist",2025-11-24T06:43:20.856Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e7mj0jmro,"A computer scientist who revolutionised the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has called for the UK to be ""brave"" in its pursuit of the technology. Llion Jones, who was part of the pioneering Google team that unlocked AI's ability to respond in a human-like form, warned against trying to compete with ""hyper-scalers"" in the United States and China. He said the ""sycophantic"" responses of the current wave of AI chatbots needed to be fixed. ""We need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you,"" he said. Mr Jones, who was raised in Bangor and Abergynolwyn in Gwynedd, north Wales, is one of the co-authors of , which introduced the Transformer architecture that put the ""T"" in ChatGPT. It was a breakthrough that now underpins the generative AI systems that are transforming business and everyday life. Still based in Tokyo, he is now the chief technology officer of Sakana AI, the firm he founded with another former Google researcher. His company focuses on speculative research into future uses of AI, something he claimed was ""unique"", as other big tech firms were focused on monetising the current wave of large language models. ""I do genuinely think that we are unique in that respect right now,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I'm trying to make the environment to give people the freedom to do the research they want, and I'm going to try and protect it as long as I can."" Mr Jones said governments in Cardiff and Westminster needed to accept the reality of a global race which was being won by America and China, and focus instead on different types of AI developments. ""I think a country like Wales, or even Britain in general, is not going to beat the hyper-scalers, right? They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs. ""It doesn't make any sense to be a part of that race, because you're not going to win. ""So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave."" He argued that ""something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research"". ""It's a bit of a longer bet, but if it pays off then you're back in the race, right?"" While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations. Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology. ""AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,"" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle. Some of the businesses at the event ""are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,"" he added. ""If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,"" Kyle said. He added that a 1% increase in small business productivity would generate £240bn worth of economic activity. AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to ""drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive"". It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology. Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government. But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales. There have been to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas. ""Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,"" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons. Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands. ""What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,"" he said. ""There's so much more benefit that comes from the modernisation of grid infrastructure. ""When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible."" Mr George warned Wales could ""lose out"" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions. Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant ""the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly"". While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots. ""They've become very sycophantic,"" he said. The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them. ""Unfortunately, humans love being told that they're right. ""This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.' ""So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you."""
China US,'My heart breaks every time I'm called a hero' - Hong Kong fire survivor,2025-12-03T23:13:49.458Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2054rdv52o,"William Li has struggled with the label ""hero"" since helping his neighbours escape the fire which engulfed the Hong Kong block of flats he had called home since birth. Instead, he is haunted by guilt that he could have saved more people from the blaze at Wang Fuk Court, which left at least 159 people dead. ""My heart breaks every time someone calls me a hero,"" says the 40-year-old, breaking down in tears. A week on from the disaster, firefighters are still combing the complex of seven burnt-out high rises for the remains of 30 of Mr Li's neighbours - people who, like him, had the misfortune to be at home when the deadly fire began. What caused the fire to start, and why more people did not escape, is now the subject of an independent committee's investigation, ordered by Hong Kong's chief executive. Already, it has been revealed that non-fire resistant netting had been fitted around the building, and the fire alarms were not working properly. The fact alarms did not go off was the reason why Mr Li was not more worried when his wife called to tell him a fire had started in their building, Wang Cheong House. Instead of rushing, he spent almost 10 minutes packing belongings. But the moment he opened the door, the extent of the disaster was all too clear: he was engulfed in billowing smoke and had to retreat inside his flat. On the other end of the phone, his wife became hysterical, but Mr Li didn't have time to panic. He had to put wet towels under the door to stop the smoke from getting in, and tried to work out what to do next. It was then he heard voices in the corridor, where the air was now so dense with smoke he was unable to see who was calling out. Covering his face with a wet towel, he found two of his neighbours by touch, dragging the couple inside to the relative safety of his flat. In a neighbouring block, Bai Shui Lin was also trying to help her neighbours. The 66-year-old is thought to have saved at least three families, banging on their doors to warn them of the fire. Mrs Bai did not survive, however. Her sons identified her body at the weekend. ""If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,"" Yip Ka-Kui told the BBC's US partner, CBS. ""But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others."" Back in Mr Li's flat, the middle aged couple revealed they had heard another voice in the corridor: a domestic worker calling for an elderly woman. But now, the voice had gone quiet. This time, Mr Li was unable to help. ""I feel very guilty,"" he said. ""Some people weren't saved and I didn't open my door again and try to find them."" Mr Li does not know yet what happened to the voice in the corridor. Nine Indonesian and one Filipino domestic workers are reportedly among the dead, but others survived - including Rhodora Alcaraz, 28, who was trapped in another flat looking after her employer's three-month-old baby and elderly mother. She too has been hailed a hero for staying by their side. All three were rescued by firefighters eventually - but not before Ms Alcaraz had sent a series of voice messages to her sister. ""I'm feeling very weak. I can't breathe,"" she said in one of the clips, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Li and the couple - named in local media as the Chows - realised they too needed to escape. Several hours had elapsed, and their options were running out. One fire exit was blocked by the flames, while Mr Li's neighbour believed the other was locked. They decided not to jump out of the second floor window due to the intensity of the fire, and the constant explosions. A subsidiary of Danish company ISS, the property manager of Wang Fuk Court, has not responded to a BBC inquiry over reports that the emergency exit was locked. ""It was the first time I felt death had something to do with me,"" says Mr Li. That's why he started saying goodbye to friends one by one via WhatsApp: ""I can't escape,"" he told them. ""If something happens to me take care of my children. Look after yourselves."" About two and a half hours after the blaze began, firefighters finally reached them on an aerial ladder. Mrs Chow told HK01, a Hong Kong-based news outlet, that Mr Li insisted the firefighters should get them out first. ""We are older and told him he should leave first. He refused and said he was young and could handle this."" When the firefighters came back for him, Mr Li felt reluctant to leave his home, which was filled with fond memories and treasured collections of photography equipment and toys. ""The fire was telling me that I couldn't take anything away, that I had no right or power to stop it from devouring everything."" Mr Li reunited with his family at a nearby fast food restaurant. But after he'd reached hospital it took until the early hours of the morning for the true extent of the horror he'd endured to make itself felt. ""I no longer had any strength in me and when I got to the emergency room, my knees gave in. A burning smell lingered in my nose,"" he says. ""I really wanted to wash away the smell."" After being admitted to a ward at 03:00, Mr Li finally had the space to cry and start trying to process the ordeal he had gone through. ""When I had been to hospital before, I wanted to go home as soon as possible,"" he says. ""But this time when the nurse asked me [if I wanted to go home], I wasn't willing to leave. I felt like I was avoiding what I would have to face in the future."" He has however decided to face the trauma upfront – by doing as many interviews as he can. ""I hope many people will come forward to help find the truth,"" he says. ""I hope Wang Fuk Court residents will be given answers and justice."""
China US,Putin says Russia ready to supply 'uninterrupted' fuel to India ,2025-12-05T12:50:31.387Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g482m3yyzo,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide ""uninterrupted shipments"" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil. Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow. President Donald Trump has imposed , arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies. Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a ""peaceful solution"" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas ""Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,"" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on ""the side of peace"", welcoming efforts to find a ""lasting"" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the ""connectivity"" of Russia and India was a ""major priority"" for India. In recent months, India-US ties have hit an as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"" at the time. In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US. ""The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,"" he asked. Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May. The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture. Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia. Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said. No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry. Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years. Modi said that ""energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership"", but made no specific reference to oil. India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions. Putin also referenced a ""flagship project"": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with. In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being ""reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms"". Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a ""more just"" and ""multi-polar"" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations."
China US,"Australia at risk of 'high-impact sabotage' from China, says spy chief",2025-11-12T03:27:44.652Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n43emvejo,"Australia's spy chief says hackers linked to the Chinese government and military are targeting the country's critical infrastructure, warning the country was increasingly at risk of ""high-impact sabotage"". Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), said ""unprecedented levels of espionage"" meant a growing threat of ""cyber-enabled sabotage"" in the next five years. He singled out ""one nation state - no prizes for guessing which one - conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate critical infrastructure in Australia"" and its allies, ""targeting water, transport, telecommunications, and energy networks"". The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment. Authoritarian regimes were now more willing to ""disrupt and destroy,"" Burgess warned. He cited two Chinese hacking groups, Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, and Australia. ""These groups are hackers working for Chinese government intelligence and their military,"" he told business leaders at a forum in Melbourne on Wednesday. ""Both groups were involved in the theft of sensitive information, but the real danger was the threat of sabotage - disruption to critical infrastructure."" He said Salt Typhoon's intent was espionage, breaking into telecommunication networks in the US. ""And they have been probing our telecommunication networks here in Australia too,"" Burgess said. He said Volt Typhoon's actions were intended to be disruptive, with hackers compromising critical infrastructure networks in the US for potential, future sabotage. ""And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well,"" Burgess said. He warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to sabotage critical infrastructure in order to ""impede decision-making, damage the economy, undermine war-fighting capability and sow social discord"". ""I do not think we - and I mean all of us - truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,"" he said. Burgess pointed out that , unrelated to foreign interference, have had significant and widespread impacts on society. ""That's one phone network not working for less than one day,"" he said. ""Imagine the implications if a nation-state took down all the networks? Or turned off the power during a heatwave? Or polluted our drinking water? Or crippled our financial system?"" Spies are increasingly ""broadening their collection requirements"", Burgess said.

China US,India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at COP30 climate summit,2025-11-21T01:17:06.411Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v8k8mlego,"At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter. India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being ""worryingly inadequate"". Delhi has argued otherwise. Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming. So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change. The that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement. But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies. UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets. The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it. All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap. But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem. Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December. So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30? Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world. A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that ""global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone"". ""For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,"" he wrote. While , Yadav seemed to expand on this argument. ""Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,"" he said. Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries. The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue. The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn. Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans. Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot. ""The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,"" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30. Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states. India says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline. Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges. Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as "" "". It has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C. Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal. In the , published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU. ""India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,"" a report by the think-tank noted. According to the recent , India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia. But the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan. And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels. It remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends."
China US,Zambian-American influencer sentenced to 18 months for hate speech,2025-12-02T14:58:51.583Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqnklqge7o,"A Zambian-American influencer and political vlogger has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech for making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema. Zambian-born Ethel Chisono Edwards, who also holds US citizenship and works as an estate agent in New York, has a large following across various social media accounts. Known as ""One Boss Lady"", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years. The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral. She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments. But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common. Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year. She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred. Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential. He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment. He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf. ""I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,"" it said. Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona. The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest. Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence. The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech. Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws. In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema."
China US,Namibia loses bid to overturn ban on rhino horn trade,2025-12-05T14:24:32.464Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30j7q6qjp9o,"Namibia's proposals to lift the ban on the international trade in black and white rhino horns have been rejected at a key conservation meeting. The result of the voting at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) earlier this week was adopted by the conference on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Namibia had also proposed overturning the ban on African savanna elephant ivory - this too was defeated. Eyebrows were raised about the rhino horn trade proposals mainly because Namibia pioneered the practice of cutting the horns off rhinos in 1989 so they no longer have value for poachers. Dehorning was followed by other southern African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa. Rhino horns are prized in traditional Asian medicine and are also status symbols in China, Vietnam, and some other south-east Asian countries. Namibia tabled two separate proposals - one for black rhinos and the other for southern white rhino. Both were resoundingly defeated, with only around 30 votes out of about 120 in favour. Cites regulations require a two-thirds majority for a proposal to be adopted. Black rhinos are listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2023, there were only 6,421 alive - a decline of more than 90% since 1960, according to an IUCN report. The southern white rhinos are not in quite such danger - they are listed as near threatened, with a population of  15,752. But this is down 11% since 2023 and at its lowest point since the current rhino poaching crisis began nearly two decades ago. Cites banned the trade in the horns and other rhino parts in 1977 but their poaching continued with more than 8,000 lost in the last decade, according to Save the Rhino International. In Namibia, the number of rhinos poached was the highest on record in 2022, with 87 killed - almost twice as many as the year before, government data shows. Although this was the first time that Namibia tabled the two proposals seeking the lifting of the ban on the rhino horn trade, the country has backed similar proposals by other southern African countries including South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe in the past. Experts say the main reason these countries want the ban to be lifted is because of the huge stockpiles of rhino horns they have amassed over the years. ""Namibia and other pro-trade rhino range states have amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn they wish to trade,"" Taylor Tench, senior wildlife policy analyst with the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the BBC. ""Namibia's stockpiles are an estimated 6.45 tonnes of white rhino horn and an estimated 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horn. South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much."" The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme. The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed. The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless. But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly. As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating. ""The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,"" said Mr Tench. ""Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised."" The governments of both countries have been approached for comment. Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts. Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures. But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching. They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues. Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN. South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said."

China US,Two popular gay dating platforms removed from Apple app store in China,2025-11-12T02:55:23.056Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98n2kye01eo,"Apple has confirmed that it has removed two of China's most popular gay dating apps  - Blued and Finka - from its app store in the country following an order from authorities. ""We follow the laws of the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,"" an Apple spokesperson said. The move has raised concerns amongst the LGBT community in the country. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy in Washington and the companies behind both apps for comment. A ""lite"" version of the Blued app remains available on Chinese app stores, according to checks by the BBC. Some other gay and bisexual dating apps are also still available in the country, like Jicco and Jack'd. Blued is one of the most widely-used gay dating apps in China, with tens of millions of downloads. Apple runs a separate app store in China, in accordance with the country's strict internet laws. Popular apps like Instagram and WhatsApp are not available in China. Android device users there use locally adapted versions of the operating system as the Google Play Store is also blocked in China. Members of the LGBT community expressed concerns about the removal of Blued and Finka, with one saying, ""I hope those heterosexual policymakers can understand that love is rare - it's not something shameful or unspeakable."" In 2022, popular US-based gay dating app Grindr was removed from Apple's App Store in China shortly after the Cyberspace Administration of China began a crackdown on content it viewed as illegal and inappropriate. The following year, the Chinese government announced new rules requiring all apps serving domestic users to register for licenses, resulting in a slew of foreign apps being removed online. The online regulator said the rules were designed to ""promote the standardised and healthy development of the internet industry.""

China US,Reform or rights rollback? India's sweeping labour law overhaul sparks debate,2025-11-28T00:00:09.578Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwk28d5yzxo,"Last week, India announced it would implement what many say are its most far-reaching economic reforms in decades - compressing 29 federal laws that regulated labour into . As a result, the number of rules that govern labour have now come down from a staggering 1,400 to around 350, while the number of forms companies had to fill in this regard have reduced from 180 to 73 - drastically lightening the regulatory burden on businesses. The laws got a parliamentary nod in 2020 but are finally set to be uniformly implemented across the country after a five-year delay and much political wrangling. Companies - which have long blamed restrictive labour practices for the atrophy in India's manufacturing sector - have given the changes a rousing welcome. ""This is part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of Trump's 50% tariffs, and an important signal that it is keen to ease doing business in India, attract more FDI [foreign direct investment] and integrate into GVCs [global value chains],"" said Nomura, a broking house. But trade unions are asking for their withdrawal and calling the codes the most ""sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers' hard-won rights and entitlements since [India's] independence"". The changes have triggered demonstrations across the country, with 200-300 people turning up at a protest in capital Delhi on Wednesday, led largely by left-leaning trade unions not aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. At the protest site, Akashdeep Singh, a 33-year-old factory worker employed at an international beverage company on the outskirts of Delhi, told the BBC that ""the laws will benefit only the employers and not workers like us"". Several others expressed similar anxieties. The government says the long-pending reforms aim to modernise outdated laws, simplify compliance, and protect workers' rights - while giving legal recognition to India's growing gig workforce for the first time. Several worker-friendly measures - mandatory appointment letters, uniform minimum wages, free annual health check-ups for those over 40, and gender-neutral pay - are welcome steps. Coupled with fewer compliance burdens, stronger social security, and an expanded definition of employees to include gig workers, these reforms could help formalise India's vast informal economy, experts say. The new codes also iron out glaring inconsistencies, such as varied definitions of the same rules that were prevalent in the previous laws, according to Arvind Panagariya, economist at Columbia University and former chairman of the Indian government's think tank Niti Aayog. ""You could not implement 100% of the Indian labour laws without violating 20% of them,"" Prof Panagariya in the Times of India newspaper. But even with the many welcome provisions, two contentious clauses in the reforms have particularly irked unions. These include rules that will make it easier for companies to fire workers and also harder for workers to legally conduct strikes. Earlier, factories with 100 or more workers needed the government's permission before they could lay off employees. Now, that threshold has been increased to 300. ""Why is the government trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce from the labour legislation?"" Sudeep Dutta, national secretary of CITU (Centre for Indian Trade Unions), told the BBC. ""Pending grievance cases for labourers are already in millions. Cases are not being registered… workers are not able to lodge their complaints and now the government is bringing in a labour code which is trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce,"" he added. Mr Dutta also said the new rules which ask workers to give a 14-day notice before going on strike - earlier applicable only to state-run companies - are further snatching away workers' powers to collectively bargain. Economists like Prof Panagariya argue that the old rules barring layoffs in firms with 100 or more workers were ""draconian,"" hampering India's competitiveness compared to countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China. He writes that a flexible labour market is key for India to attract entrepreneurs, as China did decades ago, to bring capital, technology, and global links - catalysts for economic transformation. Nomura economists agree, saying that the increase in worker threshold limit for retrenchment/closure ""should encourage firms to build larger scale factories, boosting the manufacturing sector, and expanding employment opportunities over time"". But economists like Prof Arun Kumar argue that labour restrictions alone do not explain India's weak competitiveness or the slow private-sector investment in new factories. ""Inadequate private investment is not due to these laws but due to inadequate demand, as wages [in India] are low, so mass demand remains low,"" Prof Kumar told the BBC. ""The new labour code will not have any impact on these aspects."" He warns against weakening workers' bargaining power, especially as technology displaces jobs and unemployment remains high. ""It is an issue of retaining the few rights that existed under the old system even though it was highly flawed,"" said Prof Kumar. While ideological differences remain, experts broadly agree that the outdated and complex codes - often used by inspectors to harass factory owners - needed simplification. With over half of India's working-age population out of the labour force and nearly 60% of workers self-employed, it's clear the old rules were failing. The impact of the new rules on India's manufacturing growth and investment remains uncertain, but in the short term, the transition will pose challenges for companies. ""Organisations will need to prepare for changes to wage structures, HR systems, social security provisioning and compliance governance,"" according to staffing agency BDO India. Since labour is regulated by both state and central rules, employers may face dual compliance for a while, says BDO India, even as the government deals with ongoing resistance from unions."
China US,Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash,2025-11-11T15:44:10.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko,"A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales  told Qian Zhimin she was ""the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed"". After fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures. More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. Investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul. ""If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,"" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. ""Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost."" Qian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after . She moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend. So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property. As Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could ""get rich while lying down"". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping. But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke. Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022. In the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth. Police raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices. But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme. ""The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,"" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC. One of her investo s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day. ""That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,"" he says. He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more. In addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them. ""There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment."" Investors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found. A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends. Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: ""We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance."" The company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready. Lantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly. ""Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,"" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. ""They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world."" A range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said. ""We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?"" The company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to. ""That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,"" Mr Yu says. Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog. But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li. ""Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,"" he remembers. ""We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth. ""She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations."" Mr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them. A Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme. ""The payouts suddenly stopped,"" Mr Yu recalls. ""The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough."" What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police. What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money. Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project. When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told. At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. Qian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a ""Bitcoin pioneer"", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she ""never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her"". Before her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a ""glimpse of sunlight"". The cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a that will start in earnest early next year. There are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain. It is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value. As in other ""proceeds of crime"" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond. Separately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage. The toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC. Still, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine. Mr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said. ""She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst."" Mr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines: ""Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice."""
China US,China exempts chips used by carmakers from export curbs,2025-11-10T07:02:17.905Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rp2514g4qo,"China has lifted export controls on computer chips vital to car production, the country's commerce ministry said on Sunday. Exemptions have been granted to exports made by Chinese-owned Nexperia for civilian use, it said, which should help carmakers who had feared production in Europe would be hit. At the same time, China has also paused an export ban to the US of some materials that are crucial in the semiconductor industry and suspended port fees for American ships. The moves mark an easing of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed in October to reduce tariffs on each other and pause other measures for a year. In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by Chinese company Wingtech, to try to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other goods. In response, China blocked exports of the firm's finished chips. However, it said earlier this month as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China. While Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. When it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to ""serious governance shortcomings"" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency. But when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues. In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted. Earlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that ""supply shortages were imminent"". Volvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business. But on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic that China had agreed to ""the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips"" and it would ""grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter"" provided the goods were for ""civilian use"". ""Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows."" , China's commerce ministry called on ""the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible."" Prof David Bailey from Birmingham University's business school told the BBC's Today programme that the actions of China were a ""wake-up call"" for the motor industry. ""The Dutch government may well have had good reasons to try and take control but it hadn't thought through the implications of that,"" he said. ""The retaliation from China was swift and it was brutal."" He said there was a need to find alternative processing sites, ""maybe in south east Asia, or Europe"", and for the industry to keep bigger stocks of its products in case of shortages. Meanwhile, the suspension of a ban on exports of ""dual-use items"" related to gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials to the US came into effect on Sunday and will be in place until 27 November, 2026. The ban on the exports of goods and materials that can have both civilian and military uses was announced in December 2024. China's transport ministry also said port fees charged on US-linked ships would be suspended for a for a year, effective 0501 GMT Monday. On Friday, China also announced the suspension of other export controls related to expanded curbs on some rare earth materials and lithium batteries."
China US,Thailand extradites owner of Myanmar scam city to China,2025-11-12T07:02:44.288Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20xx2pl69o,"She Zhijiang, a Chinese national accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, is being extradited to China - ending his years-long battle against the order. He has been detained in Thailand since 2022, after the Thai police arrested him acting on a Chinese request to Interpol. China accuses She Zhijiang of running illegal online gambling rings, and this week a Thai court upheld the decision to extradite him.  He arrived at a Bangkok airport on Wednesday, flanked by two security officials. His extradition comes ahead of a landmark visit by Thailand's king to Beijing - the first state visit to China by a reigning Thai monarch and a sign of deepening ties. She Zhijiang is one of the biggest names linked to the vast cyberscam hubs in South East Asia, which have trapped thousands of Chinese nationals and sparked a crackdown from Beijing. One of his most notorious projects is Myanmar's Shwe Kokko city, near the Thai border. It's portrayed in promotional videos as a resort city for Chinese tourists, but its glitzy buildings are allegedly home to fraud, money laundering and human trafficking. During a , the BBC saw very few overseas visitors. Local people there said that scam businesses were still operating. She Zhijiang and his company Yatai is sanctioned by the UK and the US for his links to rights abuses in the scam farms in their development. Speaking to the BBC from prison earlier this year, She Zhijiang maintained that his company would ""never accept telecom fraud and scams"" - though he also noted admitted that scammers were likely to enter Shwe Kokko since the city was ""completely open to anyone"". Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, She Zhijiang left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China. In 2014 a Chinese court convicted him of running an illegal lottery. But over the years he expanded his gambling business to Cambodia and other countries in the region. He also holds Cambodian and Myanmar citizenship, according to the US Treasury. The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in scam centres concentrated in South East Asia. They are often lured there by fake job offers and held against their will, forced to defraud others online or face brutal punishment. Many of them are Chinese nationals - a source of concern for Beijing. China has been ramping up crackdowns on such scam operations. In recent months it has ."

China US,Fracking has transformed an Argentine town but what about the nation?,2025-11-27T00:02:47.835Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewj1e1yk2vo,"Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time. When his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires. There was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off. Then in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed. ""We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre,"" says Mr Jiménez. ""Then the town grew and passed us by."" Fuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo's population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022, In addition to these people who are already permanently settled in Añelo, there are some 15,000 industry workers who sleep in the city every night. This has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through. Last year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres. Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed. Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface. The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron. By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas. This accounts ""for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production"", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official. He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to. Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. ""We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,"" he says. ""All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta."" The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency. ""Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],"" says Mr Gadano. ""This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices."" Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports ""is very important"" for the country, ""especially when two or three years ago we were in the red"". Yet he adds that it won't be ""the panacea"" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt. ""I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,"" he says. ""However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind."" Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors. They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank. ""Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',"" explains Mr Gadano. ""That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players."" The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted. Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection. Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government ""is doing what it has to do and what it can do"". What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. ""All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,"" notes Mr Gadano. This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns. ""We are really losing in the public debate,"" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. ""There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic."" Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. ""When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day."" Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. ""Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs."""
China US,Chatham Docks steel firm puts 85 jobs at risk,2025-12-05T10:54:00.531Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gwx1lqdno,"A steel manufacturer based at Chatham Docks has confirmed it is consulting on redundancies for 85 employees. ArcelorMittal Kent Wire, the largest steel manufacturer in Europe, began the process last week ahead of pulling out of the site on Pier Road. The company was among the opponents to now-approved plans to redevelop the docks, claiming they would be forced out of the location should they proceed. A spokesperson from ArcelorMittal Kent Wire said: ""We have informed all employees of the decision to enter a consultation process, with all jobs at the site at risk due to the severity and scale of the challenges facing the business."" The firm has faced difficulties, such as low demand, competition from China, and US tariffs, according to the . Peel Waters, which owns the site, had an application to approved by Medway Council in May 2024. An unsuccessful request to made by then-MP for Rochester and Strood Kelly Tolhurst, meant the Basin 3 proposal was not officially approved until November 2024. The application remains subject to a judicial review, which was heard at the High Court on October 29 and 30. A ruling has not yet been made. ArcelorMittal Kent Wire was one of the businesses opposed to the plan, as was the Save Chatham Docks campaign group. Peel Waters also wants to build a 950-home development on the site, which would include a supermarket and a pub. Ms Tolhurst, who campaigned to save the jobs, said she was ""absolutely devastated for the people at the docks"". ""For some people, it will be life-changing. It's not a booming jobs market at the moment, so for those people it's going to be a really frightening time right on top of Christmas,"" she said. A spokesperson for Peel Waters said: ""For over 10 years, we have tried to work with ArcelorMittal Kent Wire and other tenants to explore relocation solutions, including suggesting suitable local port locations that could meet their operational needs... ""Subject to the outcome of the ongoing judicial review, we remain committed to delivering Basin 3."""
China US,Tesla looks to reset strategy amid sluggish India sales,2025-11-27T07:40:11.867Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrn00pn1m7o,"Tesla has opened its largest sales and service hub in India even as the EV giant struggles with weak sales in Asia's third-largest economy. The centre in the northern city of Gurugram combines an experience showroom, charging, and after-sales services under one roof. The EV maker has sold just over 100 cars in India since its much publicised debut in July this year, dealership data shows. Sources close to the company told the BBC that Tesla is now focusing on strengthening India's EV ecosystem in a bid to revive sales momentum. Tesla didn't directly respond to BBC queries on the low sales figures. The Elon Musk owned EV maker has been struggling to get a foothold in India since its launch in July, receiving bookings for barely over 600 cars till mid-September, according to . Dealership data accessed by the BBC shows only a small portion of these bookings  converted into sales since deliveries started in September, even as competitor models in the premium category, from brands like BMW, BYD and Mercedes Benz reported robust sales aided by festive demand and tax cuts. The EV maker's plan to improve sales is said to include a three-pronged strategy to increase adoption, install more charging stations across the country and boost customer experience. High taxes and slow adoption remain major barriers to EV growth in India, experts say. For Tesla, the steep upfront price of its cars is another challenge. But speaking at the Tesla Centre launch in Gurugram, India head Sharad Agarwal said buyers can recoup up to two million rupees ($22,400; £16,900) over four years on fuel and maintenance - a third of the price of its Model Y sold here. ""Most of the [maintenance] service is done remotely through software updates, which reduces cost of ownership. And cost of home charging is one tenth of petrol prices,""Mr Agarwal said. ""Their [sales] numbers are low by any standard,"" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India told the BBC. ""But I think that's strategic. They have just put their foot in the door in India. And they have good potential to increase sales here in the time to come."" EVs make up less than 3% of passenger vehicle sales in India, and charging infrastructure has been slow to develop -  the country has only Tesla's cars can be charged at home, adding up to 44 miles (70.8km) of range per hour. The company is also expanding its network, including superchargers that can deliver about 170 miles in 15 minutes. Tesla's weak India sales come amid a broader slowdown in demand across its biggest markets -  Europe, China and the US. The company's profits fell in October despite record quarterly revenue, boosted by a last-minute rush from US buyers to claim an expiring tax credit. The firm said revenue for the three months to the end of September hit a record $28bn (£21bn), up 12% from the same time last year. But the company's profits dropped by 37% for the same period, partly due to extra costs linked to tariffs and research and development. In India, Musk has shown in local manufacturing, opting for an import-led strategy despite incentives announced in March last year to attract global EV makers."
China US,"They can't crush our protests, vow Georgians after year of resistance",2025-11-27T00:03:12.454Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c208w378gg7o,"""I'm standing for the future of this country,"" says Giorgi Arabuli, who has taken part in protests on the streets of Georgia's capital Tbilisi almost every night since they began a year ago. Mass demonstrations were met with violent police crackdowns as tens of thousands of Georgians turned out, angered by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's decision on 28 November 2024 to call a four-year halt on moves towards joining the EU. ""I'm from the generation of the 1990s. I've seen those dark times after the civil war,"" said Giorgi. ""Most of it was caused by Russian influence in a post-Soviet country. We don't want to go back there."" Since then Georgians have seen a ""dismantling of democracy"", , and it has prompted accusations of Russian-style rule. On the streets, the protests have evolved into a grinding war of attrition. For months, Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue was blocked for a few hours every evening. New laws and a heavy police presence forced the protesters to adapt, marching through adjacent streets and facing nightly arrests. The Georgian Dream government has imposed massive fines for blocking roads, slapped criminal charges on young protesters and most recently pushed through a law allowing up to 14 days' imprisonment for a first offence of blocking traffic, with repeat offenders facing up to a year in jail. ""Freedom for regime prisoners,"" reads a large banner carried towards the nearby Supreme Court. ""They've used every method to crush the protests... but the fact is they haven't been able to,"" says Nata Koridze. Her husband, Zura Japaridze, is one of six key opposition figures jailed after refusing to testify before a parliamentary commission into alleged crimes by the previous government. The six were jailed for up to eight months and banned from holding public office for two years. Prosecutors have since announced new charges against eight opposition leaders, including Japaridze. They now face up to 15 years for alleged sabotage and aiding foreign powers. Nata Koridze's husband is due to be released on 22 December but she says he is due to appear in court again three days later. They are accused of communicating with Western partners about government abuses - standard democratic practice - as evidence of betraying state interests. Japaridze, like all the jailed politicians, is held in solitary confinement. ""Zura has not seen anybody except for a doctor and the guard,"" she says. Georgia's path to EU membership, once the cornerstone of its post-Soviet identity, is now farther away than ever. Earlier this month, the EU's annual enlargement report delivered what , concluding it was now considered an EU candidate ""in name only"". ""Georgia is not on the trajectory to become an EU member state, neither in 2030 nor later,"" said Pawel Herczynski, rejecting the government's pledge to ensure membership by 2030. The BBC approached the head of the parliamentary committee on European integration and other Georgian Dream MPs for comment, but no-one was available. The government's public response has been increasingly hostile towards its foreign critics. Parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili has accused the EU of ""ideological and political dictates"", telling pro-government TV this month that ""today's Brussels does not want a Georgia that is like us"". ""They want a country standing on one foot,"" he complained. ""The policies and approaches in Brussels must be changed. For them, the Georgian people and their choice mean nothing, zero."" Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, won 54% of the vote in last year's disputed parliamentary elections, which monitors from Europe's OSCE security mission said were marked by several shortcomings, including intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, especially public sector employees. All opposition parties have since boycotted parliament leaving it entirely in government hands. That means increasingly repressive legislation has been passed unopposed. As well as steep fines for protesters blocking the road, there have been a restrictive broadcasting law and a law on foreign grants requiring all foreign funding for civil society and media to be approved by a government commission. Hundreds of protesters have been fined and dozens jailed, among them well-known actor Andro Chichinadze, given two years for allegedly organising protests. His theatre - once the best attended in Tbilisi - has closed in solidarity. The belief that Georgia's government is acting in Russia's interest is widespread among pro-Europeans here. They point to the ruling party's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s; legislation mirroring Russian laws targeting civil society; the government's refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine and increasingly hostile anti-Western rhetoric. Georgia's leaders reject that portrayal, describing their approach towards Russia as ""pragmatic"" and their primary duty to maintain peace with their northern neighbour. ""Where are the facts?"" said Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, denying pro-Russian bias during a recent TV interview. The government, he said, was being ""responsible to Georgian society which wants to keep peace in the country"". That is not the view of one of Georgia's most respected journalists, Mzia Amaglobeli, imprisoned for two years for slapping a police officer. ""Russia is conquering us without war. An oligarch is ruling our country, depriving us of a European future and legitimising autocratic, dictatorial rule. We need the support of the democratic world,"" she told the BBC in a handwritten letter from prison. for Freedom of Thought next month, says she has lost the sight of one eye and her remaining vision is worsening in solitary confinement: ""I have difficulty reading for even 10-15 minutes at a time."" Georgia's democratic decline intensified even before last year's elections, with a June 2024 Russian-style law on foreign influence that targeted civil society and independent media. Students played a big part in protests at the time and the government has responded with sweeping education reforms planned next February. Georgia's 19 state universities will be required to concentrate on a single academic discipline under the slogan ""one city, one faculty"". The reforms will tackle perceived problems including excessive concentration of universities in Tbilisi, duplication of programmes and inadequate state funding. The prime minister argues that funding should be ""focused on fulfilling state tasks"". Leading figures at Georgia's pre-eminent research institution, Ilia State University, say the reform is more about imposing political control and eradicating free space. ""After political parties, media and NGOs, universities must be put under pressure,"" says Nina Doborjginidze, rector of Ilia State University. ""If students are removed from the capital, they're removed from the political scene."" ""This is not about education quality, it's a political project,"" adds vice-rector Georgi Gvalia. ""This is an abrupt change in Georgia's foreign policy from being one of the most pro-European countries in the region to the most difficult partners of the West, and change towards more autocratic great powers, like Russia and especially China."" Georgia and China now have a strategic partnership and Beijing has invested heavily in Georgian infrastructure. Back on Rustaveli Avenue, teacher Rusudan Lomidze, who has attended the protests every day, says Georgia's fate is inextricably linked to Ukraine's. ""If Ukraine is forced to sign a capitulation agreement, it will be an absolute disaster for us. Our boys are fighting in Ukraine, and they are fighting for both Ukraine and Georgia."" More than 110 Georgian volunteers have been killed fighting for Ukraine, both Georgian citizens and ethnic Georgians, and the Georgian Legion is the biggest contingent of foreign fighters there. The crowds in Tbilisi are smaller than they were a year ago, but several hundred protesters still gather every night despite the risks. Reflecting on her years as a diplomat working towards EU and Nato integration, Nata Koridze now believes ""all of that has crumbled"". ""But the protest embodies an idea. And ideas live through decades, through centuries."""
China US,Charity shop finds sold for thousands at auction,2025-11-15T07:26:26.854Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1xqd9j1o,"Two pieces of Chinese porcelain discovered in charity shops have sold for thousands of pounds at auction. The items were taken to Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, whose chairman and Asian art specialist, John Axford, identified them as Chinese works from the 19th Century. A ""five dragon"" dish, which was due to be sold at a Dorset charity shop for £2, went under the hammer for £7,620 and a blue and white ""dragon"" bottle vase sold for £5,080. ""These discoveries highlight the extraordinary treasures that can still be found in the most unexpected places,"" said Mr Axford. An astute manager at the charity shop in Blandford Forum thought it was worth getting the dish valued. Mr Axford said he ""immediately recognised"" the period of the piece, due to its distinctive blue and yellow decoration. Further findings, such as the six-character Emperor Daoguang mark of the period (1821-1850) also confirmed its link to the Chinese Imperial Collection. The proceeds will go directly to the charity of the shop where it was discovered. ""These do not come onto the market very often; they're usually held in public collections or sometimes in private collections and this one has been languishing about somewhere in the south west of England,"" said Mr Axford. ""A lot of quite important Chinese imperial porcelains were brought back to Europe following the fall of the Qing dynasty. ""Almost all of the interest in the sale was from mainland China and Hong Kong,"" he said. The blue and white bottle vase was spotted by an eagle-eyed shopper in a charity shop in Surrey, for which she paid £100. Impressed by its craftsmanship, she brought the piece to Mr Axford, who confirmed that it dated from the first half of the 19th Century. ""Not only are these items culturally and historically significant but in the case of the dish, the sale will directly benefit a good cause,"" he added."
China US,Machu Picchu hit by a row over tourist buses,2025-11-24T00:06:53.799Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g8wrd61zo,"Machu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated. Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes. It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk. He admits that in the past few months ""there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here"". This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport. To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg. Back in September, local protestors angry at what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process to replace Consettur blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks. This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services. A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian. Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start. It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly. ""The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,"" he says. ""This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners."" These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur. Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province. As the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class. Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: ""We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train."" Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site ""was a nightmare for us"". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57. The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally. ""Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages."" He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment. Outside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that ""more needs to be done for the local communities"". She adds: ""We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition."" Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru. ""We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,"" he says. ""If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term."" He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather. ""[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,"" says Mr Gonzalez. ""And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion."" But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years. ""I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to."" Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Torontoy run buses to and from Machu Picchu. ""If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them."""
China US,University granted £2.5m for healthcare studies,2025-11-19T06:23:23.533Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kplp5xxw9o,"The independent regulator of higher education in England has awarded a local university almost £2.5m to create additional simulation facilities for midwife and paramedic students. In total, £2,493,703 from the Office for Students will go to the University of Worcester, which has become the third time in a row the educator has been successful in gaining such funding. According to the university, the £10.5m secured across the three rounds will benefit nearly 3,000 students. Vice chancellor and chief executive, Professor David Green, said: ""This recognition reflects the university's long and successful history of educating highly employable graduates."" The funding will enable the university to create new high-tech digitally enabled simulation rooms, including a specialist midwifery simulation suite. It will also see the purchase of a decommissioned ambulance for training paramedics. Two more highly sophisticated Anatomage tables are also set to be purchased, which show the students life-size 3D digital scans of real people who donated their bodies for science. By increasing its simulation capacity, the university said it would be able to educate even more health professionals for the future. Simon Trickett, chief executive of NHS Herefordshire and Worcestershire, said: ""This is extremely positive news for our local health and care system. ""The University of Worcester already plays a vital role in developing the highly skilled and compassionate health professionals our communities rely on, and this latest funding award will further strengthen that pipeline."""
China US,Two meals for $1: Why China's youth are not spending,2025-11-11T23:12:23.111Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pvlvdve7o,"China is facing a number of economic challenges and its government wants the next generation of consumers to start spending more for the good of all, but it is not having much luck convincing them to do so. Officials say insufficient domestic consumption across much of society is dragging on growth, but recent graduates have more reasons than most to be cautious. Youth unemployment has been hovering at just under 20% for some time, those who have jobs fear they could lose them, and the ongoing property crisis can make the prospect of home ownership seem unreachable, especially in big cities. This uncertainty is encouraging many of China's youth to instead embrace frugality, and social media has been flooded with tips on how people can survive on small amounts of money. ""My work is dedicated to a minimalist way of life,"" one full-time influencer tells the BBC. Videos by the 24-year-old, who goes by the online name Zhang Small Grain of Rice, feature content like her using a bar of ordinary soap for all her personal cleaning requirements, rather than expensive skin cleansing products. She can also be seen walking around shopping areas and showing off various bags and items of clothing which she says are good value because they'll last longer. Companies pay her to feature their goods to her 97,000 followers on the Xiaohongshu site. ""I hope more people will understand consumption traps so they can save. This will reduce their stress and relax them,"" she said. Others focus on budget eating. A 29-year-old using the name Little Grass Floating In Beijing posts videos of himself preparing basic dishes. He says he can have two meals for a little over $1 (76p). ""I am just an ordinary person from the countryside. I have neither a good educational background nor a network of influential contacts, so I must work hard for a better life"", he tells his followers. He works for an online sales firm and claims his extremely modest lifestyle has enabled him to save more than $180,000 over 6 years. Some have asked him online if he would expect his future wife and children to live the same way and what the end goal is. His response: ""I don't know"". China has developed a reputation for being an unstoppable economy, able to ride out the turmoil of the pandemic and US President Donald Trump's trade war. But analysts say it will face significant long-term challenges if it does not boost domestic spending. While the US has a problem with people racking up credit card debt, in China it's the opposite challenge. People are already inclined to save rather than spend and this only increases when there are perceptions of tough times ahead. The Chinese government has been promising for years to increase household consumption but it still accounts for only around 39% of gross domestic product (GDP), as opposed to about 60% in most developed countries. Part of the problem is that today's youth are more pessimistic than in the 1990s and early 2000s. ""Right now, making money is more important to me. I actually need to expand my income sources and cut my costs,"" a young woman in central Beijing tells the BBC. Like many other young people, her salary has been cut, she adds. ""I changed jobs, and it doesn't pay as well. Also, I don't know for how long this new job can sustain me in the future. A bad economic environment like this makes people feel down because we're not earning very much. Finding a job in the first place also isn't easy."" This level of youth unemployment - apart from spreading insecurity - makes it easier for struggling employers to cut wages because workers face a choice of accepting lower pay or diving into a highly competitive job market. A young man, also in his 20s, says there are low-level jobs available but it's hard to find decent work in one's area of expertise. ""Some of my friends are unemployed, still living at home and looking for a job,"" he says. ""They had all kinds of majors at university from financial services to product sales. The economy is a bit off right now. I hope it gets better so we can all have a better life"". And how does he rate the chances of this happening soon? ""I'm not very optimistic,"" he admits. A big concern for China's recent graduates is that the country is making a difficult transition from being a mass producer of cheap goods to a high-tech economy.  And many of these new industries don't require as many workers. Economist George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University,  has been tracking this phenomenon. He cites figures from two big recruitment firms in Beijing showing a high level of university graduates, even with master's degrees, taking jobs as delivery drivers. ""It reflects the skills mismatch between the qualifications which people are leaving higher education with and what's out there in terms of demand for labour,"" he says. ""Of course, that's not being helped by the push to become a champion in robotics and AI because, at least for the time being, this is something of a dampener on job opportunities. Tech isn't really that labour intensive."" Helena Lofgren has been studying China's consumption patterns for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs and believes its economy is relying too heavily on pouring money into preferred industries and focusing on selling products overseas in a time of considerable geopolitical uncertainty. ""People save more than they consume, and you need consumption to make up a bigger share of the economy than it's doing today in China,"" she says. ""You have a very export-oriented and investment driven economy and what we see now is that these parts are too big for the economy to stay healthy."" It is all about economic imbalance. If, for example, China suddenly lost significant export revenue would it have the tools to counter this by financially empowering its enormous domestic population? Some observers have questioned how serious the Communist Party is about increasing domestic consumption. In recent decades, the country has thrived on an investment and export model but that approach is now facing a big challenge: deflation. Would-be customers are often waiting for the price of goods to fall. If a young couple wanted to buy, say, a new lounge suite, it may make sense for them to wait to get a better deal. The longer they, and many more like them, hold off from making big purchases, the more likely companies are to cut prices, leading people to wait even longer for an even better deal. It may seem like a good idea to have cheaper goods, but deflation can force firms out of business and drag on growth overall. This could be countered by somehow fuelling optimism amongst 20 or 30-something consumers. Building a better social safety net or increasing minimum wages might help. There have been some attempts to do this by offering incentives to replace old cars, home appliances and other items but it has not significantly lifted consumption. The influencer Zhang says being cautious with spending runs deep in her country's culture. ""My grandfather's generation was very frugal, very thrifty. It is part of Chinese tradition. For Chinese people to be economical is in their bones,"" she says."
China US,E-commerce platform breach exposes nearly 34 million customers' data,2025-12-01T04:08:47.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36zwywll02o,"South Korea's largest online retailer, Coupang, has apologised for a massive data breach potentially involving nearly 34 million local customer accounts. The country's internet authority said that it is investigating the breach and that details from the millions of accounts have likely been exposed. The e-commerce platform is often described as South Korea's equivalent of Amazon.com. The breach marks the latest in a series of data leaks at major firms in the country, including its telecommunications giant, SK Telecom. Coupang told the BBC it became aware of the unauthorised access of personal data of about 4,500 customer accounts on 18 November and immediately reported it to the authorities. But later checks found that some 33.7 million customer accounts - all in South Korea - were likely exposed, said Coupang, adding that the breach is believed to have begun as early as June through a server based overseas. The exposed data is limited to name, email address, phone number, shipping address and some order histories, Coupang said. No credit card information or login credentials were leaked. Those details remain securely protected and no action is required from Coupang users at this point, the firm added. The number of accounts affected by the incident represents more than half of South Korea's roughly-52 million population. Coupang, which is founded in South Korea and headquartered in the US, said recently that it had nearly 25 million active users. Coupang apologised to its customers and warned them to stay alert to scams impersonating the company. The firm did not give details on who is behind the breach. South Korean media outlets reported on Sunday that a former Coupang employee from China was suspected of being behind the breach. The authorities are assessing the scale of the breach as well as whether Coupang had broken any data protection safety rules, South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT said in a statement. ""As the breach involves the contact details and addresses of a large number of citizens, the Commission plans to conduct a swift investigation and impose strict sanctions if it finds a violation of the duty to implement safety measures under the Protection Act."" Coupang has faced multiple cyber-security breaches in recent years, including one incident that exposed 460,000 customers' data. Major South Korean organisations have delivered harsh criticism over the latest breach. The editorial board of local newspaper Chosun Ilbo described the incident as ""preposterous"" and called for strong sanctions on firms responsible for leaks of its customer data. Another local media outlet, the Dong-A Ilbo, said the breach is ""the worst personal data leak"" in Korean history. The media outlet questioned how long the incident went unnoticed, adding that it ""means their internal data protection system barely mattered."" The breach marks the latest in a series of cyber-security incidents affecting major South Korean companies this year, despite the country's reputation for stringent data privacy rules. SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile operator, was fined nearly $100m (£76m) over a data breach involving more than 20 million subscribers. In September, Lotte Card also said the data of nearly three million customers was leaked after a cyber-attack on the credit card firm."

China US,"Buy nothing new this Black Friday, says charity",2025-11-28T06:34:36.406Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2evx9l0y2o,"A reuse charity is asking people to consider second hand this Black Friday as part of an alternative national campaign called Buy Nothing New. Kennet Furniture Refurbiz (KFR), based in Devizes, Wiltshire, collects second hand donations of furniture, homeware and appliances and is part of the national reuse network, a group of organisations which take on items to help others and sell affordably. KFR said it has passed on about 18,000 items, weighing about 340 tonnes over the last year. Daniel Thompson, managing director at KFR, said: ""We've just got to get our message out there. The reuse sector is growing, is rapidly more accepted into society."" He believes the stigma of secondhand is going: ""You've got various websites online where you can buy repurposed items, clothing, etc. I think reuse is on the up. ""Cost of living crisis is extreme at the moment so people don't necessarily have the money to spend on new items for Christmas. ""We are an alternative to that. We are an alternative to the consuming on Black Friday."" There are often Black Friday deals on appliances, but Mr Thompson explained that when they get second hand ones in to clean and refurbish, there is usually very little wrong with them, or can be quickly fixed. He explained that while recycling some items can be a good way to go, the process still produces emissions, so ""by reusing things you're generating far less carbon"". Of the 18,000 goods passed on last year by KFR, more than 7,000 were furniture and nearly 3,800 were electrical. Jen Gale, from Warminster, Wiltshire, runs a blog and podcast called Sustainable(ish) - she and her family have previously done a year of buying nothing new. She said that Black Friday can be useful if someone has a ""specific item in mind, Black Friday can be a real helping hand in terms of some financial savings"". ""I guess it becomes problematic when it's really just encouraging us to consume and to buy things that we didn't know we wanted, we don't necessarily need, and just really, encouraging that very sort of mindless and thoughtless consumption,"" she said. KFR has found itself expanding in a few ways: earlier this year it teamed up with another charity to offer house clearances. It has an arrangement with household recycling centres in Wiltshire and has opened a new location in Swindon too. It is also used by the local councils to provide furniture and appliances for those in need through the household support fund - last year this helped nearly 700 households."
China US,WHO warning over shortage of obesity jabs ,2025-12-01T14:05:41.506Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8n0753zzo,"Fewer than one in 10 people who could benefit from obesity jabs like Wegovy are able to get them, warns the as it releases its first guidance on the drugs. With more than one billion people worldwide now obese, it is calling for more widespread and fairer access to GLP-1 medication. According to projections, more than two billion will be obese by 2030 unless action is taken. High costs, limited production capacity, and supply-chain constraints are major barriers to universal access to the injections that can help people shift significant weight, says WHO. It has already added them to its (for overweight patients with diabetes) that countries are advised to provide. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Our new guidance recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care. ""While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms."" WHO says these drugs, sometime called skinny jabs, represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity, from a ""lifestyle condition"" to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease. It says the drugs can be taken long-term -  for six months or more - but must be prescribed along with advice on diet and exercise, so that people can keep the weight off. Too few people around the world can access them, says WHO. ""Our greatest concern is equitable access,"" said Tedros. Even under the current best projected scenario, the production of GLP-1 therapies could only cover around 100 million people - less than 10% of those who need them, according to the WHO. The guideline calls on countries and companies to expand access, through strategies such as voluntary licensing - where a pharmaceutical company grants permission for others to make affordable non-brand versions of its patented drug. A patent on semaglutide - the core ingredient of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy - is due to expire in several countries in 2026, meaning other drug-makers will soon be free to produce and sell cheap versions in places like India, Canada, China, Brazil and Turkey. WHO says countries must also create healthier environments to promote good health and prevent obesity. GLP-1 drugs mimick a natural hormone to slow digestion, curb appetite and increase feelings of fullness so people eat less. In the UK, the injections are prescription only medicines, which means they can only be prescribed by a healthcare professional for a person who clinically needs it. Some are available on the NHS, but more are sold privately. There is a black market and to be safe people should avoid buying from unregulated sellers such as beauty salons or via social media. People typically start to lose weight within a few weeks of starting on the weekly injections. Research suggests people may within a year of stopping the medication though, as their normal food cravings return. Being overweight or obese increases your risk for developing health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Obesity affects people in every country and was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024, according to the WHO."
China US,'It was part of my childhood' - keeping Ulster Scots heritage alive,2025-11-30T06:14:24.371Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1kpzr152o,"For Gillian Rea, speaking Ulster Scots was a normal part of her childhood and she wants to see others enjoying the culture. A newly-minted tour guide, she has turned her dream into a reality sharing her Ulster Scots heritage with those who wish to learn the history and customs. ""People travel more now, and visit other countries,"" Gillian said. ""But sometimes we don't know what's on our doorstep. ""I think it's really important to explore the culture around you, to know who you are and where you come from in order to see where you're going."" The term Ulster Scots refers to people who migrated from the Lowlands of Scotland to Ulster in the 17th century. Now, it can refer to their heritage and cultural traditions including language, music, and dance. Gillian, who is from Kilwaughter in County Antrim, was one of several people to share readings and stories at an event in Cullybackey as part of Ulster Scots Leid (language) week. Much of Ulster Scots poetry is centred around the home, work, rural living and connection to the land. This event celebrated the weaver poets, also known as the Rhyming Weavers, who wrote in 18th and 19th century Ulster, inspired by the booming linen industry. They earned this name through their style of verse that, when read aloud, sounds like the rhythm a loom makes. An Ulster Scot historian and writer, Dr David Hume, was also at the Cullybackey event. ""At this time Ulster Scots was under pressure and these people were writing bilingually in both English and Ulster Scots,"" he said. Centuries later, Gillian said Ulster Scots is facing a new raft of challenges. ""It's important to keep that language alive, particularly in the world of technology and social media where everything is becoming very much generic with how people speak. ""There's Americanisms coming in, influenced obviously from film, TV and media. ""To counterbalance that, we've got to have more celebrations of the Ulster Scots language. ""We have to keep it alive and rich by passing on these stories."" Similar to Gillian, Davy Moore also grew up in a home where Ulster Scots was part of everyday life. ""There were five of us living in the house with my mum and dad, granny and granda,"" he said. ""We spoke this way all the time. I went to a local primary school, farmer sons and daughters went there and they also spoke like that. ""The teacher didn't correct us, she let us tear away."" It wasn't until grammar school where he felt a changing attitude towards how he spoke. ""People who didn't speak this dialect or language, they would sometimes look down on it as if you were not intelligent, or you were like a redneck."" After taking a creative writing course, Davy has since published his own novel and a collection of short stories. He hopes to one day put together his own modern book of Ulster Scots poetry, in the hope that when he's gone, a younger generation may pick it up. ""I'm not saying for one minute I'm anything like the weaver poets,"" Davy joked Those who attended the Cullybackey event discussed fond memories of growing up and hearing some words and phrases that are now very rarely used. ""Instead of fed up, you'd say I'm scundered with this weather,"" Gillian said. ""If it's cold, you would say I'm foundered."" Another is the phrase ""read up"" (pronounced like red up) which means to tidy up or clean up. Davy added the use of the word ""tovi"", which means to boast. He also enjoyed talking about the use of the word ""thran"" (stubborn or difficult) - something he joked is a common trait of Northern Irish people."

Bill and Olive Miles mark each anniversary by returning to Guildford Cathedral, where they wed on 15 November 1952. The pair, now 95 and 93, met at a youth club when Olive was 16 and Bill was a couple of years older. ""I went with one boyfriend and obviously came back with another one... and I've still got the same one,"" Mrs Miles said. The couple married in front of 132 people when Mrs Miles was almost 20 and Mr Miles nearly 22, having completed his national service. She said in 1952, the ""shell"" of the cathedral was there but it is not the site seen today. It is a building that holds a lot of significance for the couple. Mrs Miles, who was born in Canada, describes Guildford Cathedral as her ""mother home"". ""I was brought up there, I was the first to be confirmed there, and it's just always been my church, it doesn't matter where else I've been,"" she said. In more than seven decades together the couple have travelled extensively, particularly after retiring, to countries including Canada, America, China, India, Nepal, Russia. Mrs Miles says they were also handy on the dance floor. ""We were reasonable dancers,"" she said. ""We did amateur dancing, and we used to go to the Butlins dancing competitions in Brighton quite often, and we maintained our dancing right up until the 60th anniversary."" The couple renewed their vows after 25 and 50 years married, and hold a reception each year to mark the occasion. These events, Mrs Miles explains, have grown smaller. ""As you get to 60 years, to 70 years, because in actual fact, when we look now at the wedding pictures of 132 guests, we are the only two left that are alive."" Their lengthy union has stood the test of time, and while there have been difficulties to manage, the Miles' remain united.

Mila Stanzani, from Trowbridge, told the BBC that getting her first podium finish at the championships in China last month was ""incredible and very surreal"". The sport of obstacle course racing is set to replace the fifth event in the modern pentathlon - which is currently equestrian - at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. But Stanzani hopes it will become a stand alone Olympic event in the future. The 27 year-old took bronze at the inaugural UIPM 2025 Obstacle World Championships held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing. Stanzani competed in the 100m sprint race held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing, which saw athletes race across a course made up of 11 different obstacles similar to what you would see on a Ninja Warrior track. On BBC Wiltshire's Sport at Six show, she said it is ""very thrilling, it's like a puzzle you need to try and solve it, but be fast as well"". Obstacle course racing (OCR) athletes need ""incredible grip strength, precision, accuracy"" according to Stanzani as well as ""a bit of confidence"". She was introduced to the sport when she was 19 years-old and hopes to become an Olympian if the sport does become its own discipline in the future. She is currently the fastest female in the sport in the UK, and said she will ""keep eating my rice and peas and just hope for the best""."
China US,Sale of Daily Telegraph collapses after US firm pulls out,2025-11-14T14:43:29.958Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993drmj1dyo,"US investment group RedBird Capital has pulled out of a deal to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph for £500m. RedBird had a previous attempt to buy the Telegraph rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi's IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family. A law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals. The new bid complied with that rule, but it is understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review. A spokesman for the group said: ""RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group. ""We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and we will work hard to help secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers."" Sources close to RedBird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest. RedBird itself has faced questions over the extent of investment it has received from China and Gulf based investors. An IMI Group spokesperson said its ""priority has been to end the uncertainty and secure the Telegraph's long-term success"" and that it remained in contact with ""interested parties"" on a deal. It said it remained committed to completing a sale, while co-operating with the government and regulators. RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market. Among other investments, RedBird Capital owns the Italian football team AC Milan.

China US,Teen builds advanced robotic hand from Lego,2025-11-26T06:13:34.165Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g1001z95o,"A teenager has designed and built a fully working robotic hand out of Lego pieces. Jared Lepora, 16, from Bristol, spent about two years on the creation, assisted by his father Nathan who is a professor in robotics at the University of Bristol. ""My dad specialises in making advanced robot hands and I thought these principles were always really cool, so why not make it out of Lego?” Jared said. Nathan hopes the Lego hand, which can pick up variety of objects including fruits and cups, could one day become a ""proper Lego set for other children"" to build. The hand, which is driven by two motors using tendons, has four fingers, each functioning with three joints. Using Lego clutch gears, the mechanics of the fingers move together until they touch an object then stop moving, similar to a human hand. After building the hand and jointly writing an academic paper on it with his father, Jared was invited to give a speech at the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025 conference in Hangzhou, China, and was the youngest speaker there. Nathan said he used to take his son into the lab during summer holidays, where he got familiar with 3D-printed designs while chatting with PhD students. ""And he had the idea of making one out of Lego...maybe he'll become my boss someday,"" he said. ""This genuinely could be of interest to other children to engage with advanced robotics, it's a way in for them. ""If anyone can build the hand, and maybe other children can make design changes, then that's really exciting. ""Wouldn't it be amazing if it could be a proper Lego set for other children, that would be exciting,"" he added."
China US,What was agreed on climate change at COP30 in Brazil?,2025-11-22T21:34:13.368Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gqez4lkyo,"Countries have reached a new deal to tackle climate change at the annual UN meeting in Belém, Brazil. But , with no new measures on fossil fuels or deforestation. COP30 was the 30th annual UN climate meeting. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"". ""Parties"" refers to the nearly 200 countries that have signed up to the original UN climate agreement of 1992. COP30 was due to run from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. But the talks overran into Saturday 22 November. World leaders gathered on Thursday 6 and Friday 7 November, before the conference began. The host nation is chosen by participating countries after a nomination from the host region. The conference was held in Brazil for the first time. The choice of Belém, on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, caused significant challenges. Some delegations struggled to book affordable accommodation, leading to concerns that poorer nations could be priced out. The decision to to build a road for the summit also proved controversial. Brazil also continued to grant which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were among those to attend the leaders' summit. UN secretary general António Guterres and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also there. The Prince of Wales, attending on behalf of King Charles, gave a speech calling for countries to come together to tackle the ""fast-approaching"" threats of future climate change. But many leaders were absent, including China's President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. China and the US are the two biggest emitters of planet-warming gases. Delegations from more than 190 countries, including a large number from China, attended the talks, however. The US government did not send any national officials, although some local and state leaders did attend. Politicians and diplomats were joined by scientists, campaigners and journalists. Previous summits have been criticised for the large number of attendees who are connected to the coal, oil and gas industries. Campaigners argue this shows . COP30 took place at a time when global climate targets were under significant strain. In Paris in 2015, nearly 200 countries to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels and to keep them ""well below"" 2C. There is very strong scientific evidence that the impacts of climate change - from extreme heat to sea-level rise - would be far greater at 2C than at 1.5C. But while the use of renewable energy - particularly solar power - is , countries' climate plans have fallen short of what the 1.5C goal requires. Ahead of COP30, countries were supposed to have submitted updated plans detailing how they would cut their emissions of planet-warming gases. However, had done so by the end of October. UN secretary general António Guterres warned that ""overshooting"" 1.5C is inevitable, given how close the target is and how high emissions remain. But he said he hoped temperatures could still be brought back down to the target by the end of the century. Brazil hoped to agree steps to deliver commitments made at previous COPs. At COP28, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2023, about the need to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"". Brazil wanted the talks to secure clearer steps for how countries would achieve this. The idea of such a ""roadmap"" had been backed by dozens of countries, including the UK, but was strongly opposed by others, including those reliant on fossil fuels. In the end, the deal mentioned that existing UAE agreement - but did not strengthen the language around moving away from fossil fuels. Brazil announced its own plan to launch a fossil fuel ""roadmap"" which countries could sign up to - but it sits outside the main deal. At COP29, richer countries committed to give developing nations to help them tackle climate change. But that is far less than poorer countries say they need. That agreement also included an aspiration to raise this to $1.3tn from public and private sources. Ahead of COP30, Brazil published a ""roadmap"" detailing how the $1.3tn goal could be achieved. The COP30 deal called for a trebling of money to help the worst affected nations to adapt to the impacts of climate change, by 2035. But it's not clear how much will come from public versus private sources. And richer nations have consistently undelivered on their cash promises. At the leaders' summit ahead of COP30, Brazil launched the ""Tropical Forests Forever Facility"" - a fund which hopes to raise $125bn (£96bn) from loans and investments. The aim is to try to prevent the loss of tropical forests by rewarding countries who keep their forests standing. But the UK said it would not be committing public money - though could do so in the future and would encourage the private sector to invest. Brazil announced plans to launch a roadmap outlining steps to meet the pledge to halt and reverse deforestation, which was made in COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. But, like fossil fuels, this deforestation roadmap did not make it into the final deal. UN climate talks rely on consensus - all countries present have to agree in order to pass a deal. That can be challenging. Different nations have competing priorities, based for example on their dependence on fossil fuels, economic position or vulnerability to climate change. The backdrop for the talks this year was dominated by the fracturing consensus on tackling climate change, not least from the Trump administration. The US President has pledged to , and roll back green initiatives put in place by his predecessors. Some observers, such as campaigner Greta Thunberg, have accused previous COPs of ""greenwashing"" - letting countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without actually making the changes needed. Significant global agreements have been reached at previous COP sessions, allowing greater progress than national measures on their own. Despite the difficulties of delivering the 1.5C warming limit, the commitment - agreed at COP21 in Paris - has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN. This has helped bring down the level of anticipated warming - even though the world is still not acting at the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals. But the view from many scientists and observers is that the agreements made at COP30 are unlikely to shift the dial much on climate change. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

China US,The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis,2025-11-21T08:03:37.342Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkgxeeyzno,"""Everyone comes in here, it's very cheap. I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries,"" says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. ""It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?"" The store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis. Instead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street. More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid ""challenging trading conditions"". It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year. Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales. These places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops. So why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time? One thing is clear - we're not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed. ""[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops,"" says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. ""[They're doing this] by saying, 'These are things I'm going to buy from you.' ""They know their prices inside out."" Sometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices. But that's not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition. All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers. For pound shops in particular, it's even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn't what it used to be. After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today. Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago. In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above. ""We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,"" he says. ""What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous."" But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right. His Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries. ""We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they're going to buy it,"" he declares. As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers. ""We've got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices,"" he says. So, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of ""extra margin"". If you don't get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel. The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later. ""They just didn't understand the discount business,"" he argues. ""They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it."" Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs. Poundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making. The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. Its owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn't popular with shoppers. ""Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth. But she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan. This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead. The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then. Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents. And shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains. Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes. By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car. But budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis. Not only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of ""extreme discounting"" online to contend with. Today, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There's also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers. ""AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it's growing,"" says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel. Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period. Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul. ""If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you'd find on Temu etc, so if Amazon's doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it's notable,"" says Mr Carroll. ""There's a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come."" There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock. ""As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that,"" she says. ""It's not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody."" The danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market. All this coupled with a ""cost-of-business crisis"" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth. ""You've got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you're at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it's super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there's so many people in that market. ""But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out."" It's not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently. The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too. Savers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland's Peckham store space. OneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs. ""Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing."" As for current trading, he says, he is getting by. ""We're not saying we're earning fortunes of money. We're not - but we're paying our way, and we're just waiting for better times."" His focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading. ""It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas,"" he says. Catherine Shuttleworth reckons that's where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. ""They're a great place to go and deck your house out."" But also, they may be the only place many households can afford to shop. Not everyone likes to shop online, or wants to make the trip to a retail park. ""For some people, budget shopping is a hobby,"" she adds, ""but for others it's an absolute necessity."""
China US,More than 100 Aston Martin jobs 'at risk' in St Athan  ,2025-11-07T19:10:05.727Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c874wxdgqv3o,"More than 100 jobs are at risk at the Aston Martin St Athan plant in the Vale of Glamorgan, BBC Wales has been told. The company has blamed losses on US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and weak demand from China. Aston Martin, which started production in south Wales in 2019, said its proposals remain under consultation but no final figures on jobs have been confirmed. The Unite union described the situation as ""devastating"" and said it would begin a consultation with the company to mitigate redundancies. in response to continued challenges in the global macro-economic environment. It said the actions it was taking ""may affect contractor, fixed-term and permanent roles"". Staff production jobs make up the majority of roles being consulted on as well as a number of contractor positions, BBC Wales was told. Andrew Pearson, Unite regional officer, said the news was ""devastating"" for the workforce at Aston Martin. Aston Martin has seen its shares tumble during the year and last month said it faced losing £110m due to the ""global macroeconomic environment"". The Welsh government said it is in contact with Aston Martin and is prepared to to work with the company to offer support to workers following the outcome of the consultation. The current round of potential job cuts follow a decision by the company to cut 170 jobs at St Athan in February."
China US,Marsh solar park plans questioned by campaigners,2025-11-27T06:00:25.703Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrvjkr1jxo,"Campaigners against proposals to build three large-scale solar parks claim the government's ambition to treble the amount of solar capacity in the UK is ""fundamentally flawed"" and ""damaging"". Amanda Farrant, who lives near the proposed Shepway Energy Park, says if plans are approved it would be ""like living in the middle of a massive, great big solar power station"". Three solar parks being put forward for Romney Marsh in Kent are at various stages of planning and consultation. None have yet been submitted to the planning inspectorate. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said solar contributed in 2024. Opponents to the Romney Marsh plans they will damage unique and fragile habitats and take up productive farm land. Ms Farrant, who formed the Hands Off Our Marsh campaign, believes there are better options to solar energy calling it ""too intermittent"" and that the government's solar ambitions are generating a solar ""gold rush"". ""It's all about speed and getting it done quickly,"" she claimed, adding the approach could lead to ""devastation"" of the rural environment. There is scepticism from some about the effectiveness of solar panels. Prof Tony Day, an independent energy consultant and visiting professor at London South Bank University, said the government target would only deliver 2-3.5% of national energy needs in the depths of winter. ""Even in the peak of summer the average monthly power output is around one fifth of headline capacity figure,"" Prof Day said. ""No other generation asset would be considered viable with this type of delivery or energy risk profile."" The government's hopes the UK will have 45-47GW of solar capacity by 2030. Proposals for a 500MW South Kent Energy Park in Old Romney would see more than 1,400 acres turned over to solar. Plans for the 200MW Shepway Energy Park, near Newchurch, see an area made up of six sites covering more than 1,000 acres. South Brooks Solar Farm's 500MW plan is made up of several sites potentially over more than 2,700 acres. If approved they would be three of the biggest solar parks in the country. Due to the size of the proposals they are classed as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) and the decision to approve or reject the plans is made at a national level, not by local councils. Since coming to power Labour has approved 11 NSIP solar parks around the UK. Colin Woollard, who lives and works on Romney Marsh, bought 256 solar panels from China in 2023 to power his motorsport engineering manufacturing business, with a 140KW capacity. He says when he bought them he was sold the idea that it would work all year round. ""It just doesn't,"" he said. Mr Woollard said on a cloudy day in November they only generated 21 kilowatts, which he said was ""basically seven kettles of water"". He questioned the ability to ""run a country"" on such an inefficient model. The government says solar offers potential to boost the country's energy independence, bring down bills and tackle the climate crisis. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""Solar is one of the cheapest forms of power and – alongside upgrades to the electricity grid – will help us get us off fossil fuels and delivering energy security so we can get bills down for good. ""All projects are subject to rigorous planning processes, and the views of the local community must be taken into account."" The three developers of the proposed sites said they had consulted residents and that the feedback would help to inform the projects."
China US,"We will be hammered in the budget, says 64-year-old",2025-11-21T06:03:47.304Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8e7zv510no,"A man in his sixties with disabilities says he feels he will ""get hammered"" whatever happens in the Budget announcement on 26 November. Andy Watson, 64, lives in Stotfold, Bedfordshire, and has serious mobility problems. He has also had a liver transplant and two types of cancer. He says he was hoping that some of the in the budget do not turn out to be true. When sitting with a cigarette in his mouth in the room where he spends most of his life, Andy Watson does not look like a survivor. But somehow, he says, he is still ""living and breathing"". After receiving a lung transplant 22 years ago, he was diagnosed with lung cancer eight years ago. Bowel cancer followed in 2022, along with back problems. ""My spine is poking into the spinal cord,"" he said, ""so walking is very difficult, very very painful. ""I've been receiving injections in the spine for the last few years, but you're only allowed so many of them and they stopped."" Mr Watson says he is on a waiting list for hospital treatment, but in the meantime  his mobility is ""lousy"" so he is ""stuck in the house"" apart from visits to a nearby coffee shop. ""Whatever happens in the budget,"" he said, ""we know we're going to get hammered. ""I'm just hoping [the government] are going to breach their manifesto and there's a call to arms by everybody for them to have another election. ""It's gone beyond the point of saying 'yeah, they've just got in, they've got to find their feet'."" Mr Watson believes the economy has only got worse over the past 18 months and the government is ""just investing more and more money on immigrants"". He believes paying £49.18 a week to asylum seekers has resulted in the government being forced to consider new unpopular charges in the budget. He also spoke against the government housing migrants in hotels as the accommodation was ""still a hotel, still a nice little holiday joint"". concluded that while the media and politicians ""depict people seeking asylum as living in luxury...  the reality could not be more different."" The government said it would , saving the taxpayer billions of pounds. Mr Watson says pensioners are suffering financially despite ""contributing to the country all these years - but Mr Starmer don't think about that, it's a joke"". The state pension is currently £230.25 per week while the allowance for an asylum seeker goes down to £9.95 per week if their accommodation supplies meals. Mr Watson said his own income, which is made up of a Personal Independence Payment, Employment and Support Allowance and a mobility allowance, was ""a couple of hundred pounds a week to live on [and I] contribute towards running a house, buying food"". Mr Watson said: ""[The government is] on about taxing your mileage. ""Scrap the road tax - just put it on the petrol [so] we're all paying equal."" A spokesperson for the Treasury said Vehicle Excise Duty was forecast to raise approximately £9.1bn in the current financial year, which would go towards funding public services. Mr Watson would like some measures in the budget to give him a little more income: ""I'm very lucky, my wife has retired, so she has a pension. ""She pays the majority of the bills and the running costs, other than that it's very, very tight. ""It would be lovely to be off on nice holidays and all the rest, but you can't do it."" He said he enjoyed a ""couple of little mini-breaks a year"" with his wife Liz in the UK. Before his health forced him to give up his job eight years ago, Mr Watson was running a shop selling mobility aids. ""We miss it,"" he says, ""we miss the banter - it was lovely to help people."" Although he has left the world of business behind, he has a keen interest in what owners of small businesses are going through. At the moment, bosses have to register for VAT if their turnover over 12 months is greater than £90,000. The think tank, The Resolution Foundation, has suggested the government drops the threshold to just £30,000 to increase competition, but Mr Watson is not impressed. ""What a joke,"" he said, ""I know a few shopkeepers, they're closing earlier now, because they are frightened to death of going over and into the VAT."""
China US,"Shoppers loved the 'fabric queen'. Then, order by order, her story fell apart",2025-12-05T19:02:48.772Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y937w7xl7o,"At 6ft tall and plus-size, shop-bought clothes had never fitted Maree O'Connor well. Sewing offered her a solution - allowing her to use beautiful fabrics to make garments that fit just right. One day, while on the lookout for colourful prints to make new dresses, she spotted some ""amazing"" fabrics being sold online. Enticed by a yellow floral pattern and another black-and-white abstract design, she splashed out $600 (£450, A$900) on three orders. Months later, none had arrived. It was October 2024, and tired of waiting, the legal studies teacher from Melbourne, Australia, decided to set up a Facebook group to try to find out if anyone else was in the same boat. The group exploded. Within two weeks it had drawn hundreds of members, according to Ms O'Connor. She had unearthed a scandal that would consume the sewing world - from China to Europe, to the US. In the group, other sewing enthusiasts detailed how they too had been waiting months - and in some cases years - for fabrics to arrive, while a supplier alleged it was owed tens of thousands of dollars. At the centre of the controversy was globally renowned designer, Nerida Hansen. Her company had grown rapidly during the pandemic, when she made a name for herself selling bold, distinctive fashion prints that set her shop apart from other retailers. Popular with sewists - as members of the sewing community call themselves - around the world, her fabrics often appeared in influencers' Instagram posts. Some newspapers had even dubbed her Australia's queen of fabrics. ""People liked what she was doing and producing,"" said UK-based artist Gabriela Larios, who has worked with Ms Hansen. ""My impression of her was that she was doing something different and new in Australia,"" added Sarah Rowe, another artist who worked with Ms Hansen. ""I was impressed by her, she was formidable."" That's exactly what excited Bergen Anderson, who ordered more than $3,300 (£2,500; A$5,000) of Ms Hansen's fabrics in 2024. She planned to use them to make clothes which she would sell through her US-based children's clothing business. But, as in Ms O'Connor's experience, none of Ms Anderson's goods arrived within the eight-week window that was promised. Instead, she received a number of what she described as ""generic"" emails, saying her orders were soon to be printed and shipped. She also received a number of emails from Ms Hansen saying suppliers were delayed sending goods because of events like national holidays. ""It was every excuse under the sun,"" Ms Anderson said. Frustrated and in search of answers, she too stumbled upon Ms O'Connor's Facebook group. In it, she found customers wondering where their money had gone - and why the company was still accepting orders even though so many people were saying their fabrics hadn't been printed or shipped. Suspicious of Ms Hansen's business practices, Ms O'Connor encouraged customers to request refunds and dispute transactions with their banks. Ms Anderson only managed to get two out of three payments reversed through her bank, meaning she was still $808 (£606; A$1,224) out of pocket. Meanwhile, Ms Hansen had become aware of the Facebook group and contacted Ms O'Connor asking for it to be taken down, claiming that content posted in the group was defamatory - a claim Ms O'Connor rejected. Ms O'Connor said Ms Hansen also offered her an immediate refund if she no longer wished to wait for her goods. ""I got my refund pretty much straight away, because she wanted to shut me up."" But she decided not to shut up - or delete the group. ""She was just going to continue to do what she was doing, and take money from people because people were siloed right, they didn't know what was going on."" In the group people were sounding alarm bells about announcements from Ms Hansen saying she was rebranding, worried about what that would mean for their undelivered orders. Ms Hansen went on to trade under a number of different business names online. By then the group had grown beyond disgruntled customers to also include Nerida Hansen's suppliers. William Shan worked for a supplier in China that sold material to Ms Hansen's company - until, he said, the payments stopped. He was ""helpless"" when he ""accidentally discovered"" the Facebook group, he said. Mr Shan alleged Ms Hansen's firm failed to pay for two fabric shipments worth $52,000 (£39,000; A$78,700) in 2022. He said he initially felt sympathy for Ms Hansen, who he thought ""may have encountered difficulties"". He continued supplying her in the hope it would ""help her recover as soon as possible and collect her [company's] debts"". But he says later orders - worth thousands of dollars - also went unpaid. ""We [trusted Nerida] too much. From 2020 to the end of 2021, Nerida's credit [had] been consistently good. So we did this stupid thing of continuing to supply her,"" Mr Shan said. Mr Shan's company said it had hired numerous lawyers to try to recover the money owed by Ms Hansen's companies, but she and her business associates stopped communicating. The BBC also spoke to 11 artists and illustrators who said they had not been paid for their work with Ms Hansen's brand. Clémence Albertus, based in France, said she had been approached by Ms Hansen at an art fair in Paris about collaborating on fabric prints. Given Ms Hansen was ""really known for her fabrics"", Ms Albertus said she chose to trust her. According to Ms Albertus, Ms Hansen wanted to license one of her designs to be sold in collaboration with a large European fabric retailer called Verhees - an opportunity Ms Albertus didn't want to miss out on. But after sending over her design, a delicate floral print, she heard nothing from Ms Hansen for months. ""I thought Verhees changed their mind, or that the collaboration Nerida x Verhees failed,"" Ms Albertus said. That was until one day in August last year, when she discovered her pattern ""by chance"" for sale on the Verhees website. She said it had been edited in different colourways without her consultation. Ms Albertus contacted Ms Hansen numerous times asking about royalty statements and payment details but is yet to receive any money. ""It has been a real deception,"" she said, adding that she estimates she is owed €2,000-€4,000 (£1750-3500; A$3,500-7,000). Verhees told the BBC it was not responsible for royalty payments owed to designers featured in its collection, and that Ms Hansen was solely responsible for paying these. It added it had now suspended the Nerida Hansen x Verhees collaboration. Not all the artists who spoke to the BBC felt Ms Hansen was totally to blame for the lack of payments from her businesses. Bron Alexander, based in New Zealand, said while she was owed payments for previous projects with Ms Hansen, it was her own fault she hadn't been paid for her Verhees collection work as she'd failed to provide invoices when asked by Ms Hansen's team. Ms Alexander added that she believed Ms Hansen was a ""visionary"" and said she had ""much empathy"" for her financial situation. ""She only ever wanted us [artists] to be successful."" Others insisted business simply wasn't Ms Hansen's forte. ""I truly believe she wanted the best for everybody, I truly believe she wanted to be able to deliver, I truly believe she wanted to be able to pay everybody,"" said Sarah Rowe, an artist who used to collaborate with Ms Hansen and is not owed any money. ""I really believe she had good intentions to do all those things, and I also believe business is not her jam."" Ms O'Connor felt differently. ""I think she's quite intentional in what she's doing,"" she said. ""If she was a disorganised businesswoman she would have quit a while ago."" In September 2025, nearly a year after Ms O'Connor started the Facebook group, a public warning against Ms Hansen and her businesses was issued by the Victoria state consumer rights agency. It was the result of multiple complaints - Ms O'Connor had advised fellow customers on the group to report their experiences to Australian authorities. ""I urge consumers to be wary about purchasing goods from Hansen's online platforms or engaging further with Hansen,"" Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV) director Nicole Rich said. The warning said that over the course of one year, the agency had been contacted more than 120 times by customers claiming to have lost more than $19,800 (£14,900; A$30,000) in purchases. It also said Ms Hansen had operated online under a range of business names, including Indigo Palm, The Kind Merch Co, Nerida Hansen Fabrics, Rebel Quilts, Australian Surface Art Collective, Fabric and Design and Nerida Hansen Print and Textiles. Ms Hansen said this was untrue, denying she used all of these to trade. After the warning was issued, Ms Hansen announced she would be shutting down her businesses by the end of the month to start a new career. But she continued promoting fabric sales on the website domain names Global De-stash and neridahansen.com into November. In a statement to the BBC, Ms Hansen admitted she had made some ""very poor"" decisions relating to her businesses, adding her actions had caused her ""great shame and embarrassment"". She said she had experienced financial difficulties that led to her liquidating her company in late 2022 - before opening a new one in a new name. Following that, she said she fell further behind with orders in 2024, citing supplier issues and business mismanagement, but insisted she was still in control of the situation. ""Even though I mismanaged orders terribly I was steering my own business wheel,"" she said. She had intended to have all orders completed by the end of January 2025, she said, but the creation of the Facebook group had led to a wave of refund requests and bank chargebacks being submitted all at the same time. This left the business overwhelmed, Ms Hansen said, and caused her trading account to be frozen. She still intended to fulfil every order and refund owed to her customers, she stated, but did not currently have the means to do so. She alleged the attention brought to her businesses online by Ms O'Connor's Facebook group had amounted to ""horrific social media harassment"" and defamation. She claimed Ms O'Connor went beyond advocating for justice online. She accused her of encouraging others in the Facebook group to engage in what she describes as amounting to ""digital stalking"" and ""physical stalking"", and that Ms O'Connor ""publicly made deliberate attempts to sabotage [her] livelihood"". Ms O'Connor disputed these allegations saying they were ""outrageous"". ""Customers being persistent and demanding in terms of seeking a refund or product that the vendor had happily taken money for is not harassment,"" she said. Despite everything that has happened, Ms O'Connor is determined to continue sewing - though she insists she will never wear any of Nerida Hansen's designs again. She will continue to fight until Ms Hansen's businesses are shut down, she says. ""Some people are still awaiting justice and we hope that can be achieved."""
China US,PIP withdrawn from amputee over cricket video,2025-12-04T06:40:46.648Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9z00y2p1yo,"The family of a man who lost his leg when he was two years old have asked for a rethink of a decision to strip him of his disability benefits and force him to pay back £36,000. Shaun Rigby from Telford had his Personal Independence Payment (PIP) withdrawn after a video emerged, showing him take part in a game of cricket. But his family said: ""Playing cricket does not negate Shaun's disability; it showcases his determination to lead a fulfilling life despite it."" The Department of Work and Pensions said its decision had been backed by an independent tribunal and PIPs were ""awarded based on how a condition impacts a person's day-to-day needs, as opposed to the condition itself"". In an online petition, Mr Rigby's family said he had ""overcome incredible odds since losing his leg below the knee in a tragic tractor accident when he was just two years old"". They said despite his physical challenges, the 37-year-old had tried to ""live as fully as possible, embracing activities like cricket not only for his own mental and physical health but also to share joyful moments with his family"". Mr Rigby said he used to play for England's disability cricket team, before eventually having to give it up. He said: ""I stopped playing about 2014, just because I couldn't do what I wanted to do, my body was sort of breaking down."" Since then, he said the pain became worse and he was successful in applying for PIP in 2016 and a Motability car three years later. But the DWP decided to withdraw both after their attention was drawn to the video of him playing cricket in 2023. His family said it had been ""a light-hearted community cricket match"". They argued that ""participating in adaptive sports is a well-known form of rehabilitation and psychological well-being for individuals with disabilities"". The decision to strip him of his benefits took away his independence and his ability to care for his family, they said. Mr Rigby said he understood why the DWP had made the decision, but wanted the government department to know he played despite his condition and did it partly to inspire others. He said he would undergo six days of ""torture"" after playing, because of the pain. The family has asked the DWP to reassess his case and reverse the decision. His wife, Lauren, said losing the PIP payments was difficult in itself, but the thought of having to repay the £36,000 was causing the family ""stress and worry"". ""Do they want us to go into poverty?"" she asked. Mrs Rigby added she wanted to push back at some of the negative comments they had received after it was announced he would lose the payment, but that there had been ""nothing but good comments"" since the online petition was launched. The DWP said: ""Following Mr Rigby's appeal, where he was able to challenge his benefit entitlement, an independent tribunal agreed with DWP's decision."" It also said that every PIP claim was different, because of individual circumstances  ""including age and the ability to manage a condition without supervision or assistance"". Mr Rigby is waiting to hear what the weekly repayments will be on the £36,000 and believes it could be up to £35 a week. The DWP said it was committed to working with anyone struggling with repayment terms."
China US,Cameroon's opposition leader in The Gambia after fleeing for his safety ,2025-11-24T11:26:59.659Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dyjn1mne5o,"Cameroonian opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who is contesting the outcome of the presidential election, has fled to The Gambia for his safety, The Gambian government has said. Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he is the legitimate winner of the 12 October election, alleging that the result was rigged to give President Paul Biya, 92, an eighth term. The Gambian information ministry said on Sunday that Tchiroma Bakary arrived on 7 November and was allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds. Cameroon's government had threatened to put him on trial for allegedly inciting violent post-election demonstrations. He denied the allegation, and blamed the security forces for a crackdown on protesters. The government put the number of people killed in post-election violence at 16, but other organisations have given a higher death toll. Tchiroma Bakary has repeatedly promised to resist Biya's government until his ""victory"" in the election is recognised. Biya, the world's oldest president, has been in power for 43 years, and was declared the winner with 53.7% of the vote amid allegations of fraud. Tchiroma Bakary, who served in Biya's government for many years, came second with 35.2%. His resistance tactics have included calling for street protests and ""ghost town"" operations aimed at bringing cities and towns to a standstill. Until The Gambian government confirmed his presence, his whereabouts had remained a mystery although there was speculation that he had fled to another country in the region. ""He is being hosted temporarily in The Gambia purely on humanitarian grounds in the spirit of African solidarity and for the purpose of ensuring his safety while discussions continue to pursue a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the post-electoral tensions in Cameroon,"" The Gambian government said in a statement. The Gambian authorities said the country would not be used as a ""base for subversive activity against any state"". The BBC has reached out to the Cameroonian government for comment. Reacting to the announcement, The Gambia's main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) criticised the government for withholding the announcement of Tchiroma Bakary's arrival until Sunday. It said it raised ""serious questions about transparency, accountability, and respect for The Gambian people's right to know what actions are taken in their name"". However, the party said it was proud that Tchiroma Bakary could find ""safe sanctuary"" in The Gambia, adding that it was fully aware of how ""despotism operates and how dissenters are treated""."
China US,"'Tell me, how do I make money Rachel Reeves?'",2025-11-30T06:25:48.578Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75vwg51wxgo,"Once a chancellor has delivered their Budget speech in Parliament, it is usual they visit somewhere for a photo opportunity and pitch policies to the country. Rachel Reeves chose a London hospital to highlight her commitment to the NHS. But she would have been very welcome in Braintree, Essex, at Toast – an East Anglian coffee chain that sources many of its ingredients locally. Whether she would have enjoyed hearing the thoughts of owner Rob Ely is a different matter. ""It feels like the government are literally taxing us on everything they possibly can,"" he said. Mr Ely is reeling from what he feels is another blow for his business, after a recent rise in national insurance payments and pension contributions. ""I would absolutely welcome Rachel Reeves - come to my business. I will give you an open book. You tell me how I make money?"" Mr Ely has six coffee shops.  When we meet in person, nearly every table in his Colchester store is full at lunchtime and there is a steady stream of customers coming in for their takeaway brews. He wants a profit margin of 10% but says increased taxes, costs and wages mean it is not achievable, leaving him frustrated. an hour from April - slightly higher than the current inflation rate of 3.6% - and 8.5% for 18-20 year-olds to £10.85 . ""It's fantastic for all of those people that are going to get more money in their pocket, he said. ""I heard the Chief Secretary [to the Treasury] said it is a slight increase.  That is not a slight increase, it is a big increase. It is going to cost me £70-£80,000 a year,"" Mr Ely claimed. Prices at Toast almost certainly will have to go up, but he said there is a limit to how much people will hand over for a cup of coffee. Matt Kimber is standing on his bustling Basildon factory floor. ""I'm genuinely more positive than I was"" he said after the Budget Mr Kimber is managing director of family-run metal works company GK Engineering. It makes steel structures like staircases for NHS hospitals and new apartment blocks.  The firm employs 50 people and has a £9m turnover. ""We've seen some good things about public spending in our sector. There's some good things about apprenticeships. We are not overly impacted by minimum wage.  They are a skilled workforce so we are above minimum wage,"" the 36 year-old boss said. But Mr Kimber feels there is still ""some uncertainty"" as a lot of the measures announced won't start for a couple of years. Darren Sharp is one of the welders at GK Engineering and he feels in the past five years things have got financially tighter. The Chancellor said ""cutting the cost of living"" was one of her three priorities in the Budget - along with cutting NHS waiting times and the cost of debt. But after this Budget, Mr Sharp said: ""For me personally, it's not going have that much of an effect. ""I don't think they have been spending money in the right places. I would like to see them spend more on defence with threats from Russia and China."" He has older children so will not be affected by the two-child benefit cap being scrapped but the 54 year-old welcomed the freezing of prescription charges. The owner of the Dragonfly Lounge in Colchester, an LGBTQ+ bar and community space, was uncertain of its future pre-Budget. Jo Palmer-Tweed said Rachel Reeves' second Budget was ""a mixed bag"". ""I'm very pleased about the business rates decision for hospitality because that is potentially quite a big cut.  That was very pleasing,"" she said. The Chancellor announced that there will be permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses from next year in properties with an annual rental value less than £500,000. The Dragonfly Lounge opened earlier this year and its property hasn't been valued yet but Ms Palmer-Tweed is hopeful it will lead to a reduction. She said they will be ""impacted"" by the rise in national living wage and the freezing of the income tax thresholds. ""The income tax hikes are going to impact different parts of our customer base. ""Overall for us in the shorter term [the Budget] has been good for us. But in the longer term it's going to really depend in how it shakes out in terms of customer spending,"" the owner of the Dragonfly Lounge said. Before the Budget, Ms Palmer-Tweed, also known as Mamma Dragonfly, was worried whether they would survive next year as a safe space for the LGBQ+ community in Colchester to go out at night.  After the Budget she is more confident."" ""It improves our chances in the longer term. I think it is a really good start for Rachel Reeves but I think we could do more"". So a photo opportunity at the Dragonfly Lounge for the Chancellor might find some raising their glasses to her.  But if growth drags, taxes bite into disposable incomes and customers sashay away from the night time economy Rachel Reeves may face a tough crowd here."

China US,Why India caps pollution reading at 500 when the air is far more toxic,2025-11-16T00:00:03.510Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6jgg0180o,"For millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge. For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days. This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500? India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as ""severe"" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the So why was that threshold introduced? ""It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,"" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation. But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher. ""International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,"" says Mr Beig. ""That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms."" The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment. Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms. Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds. ""WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,"" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading. In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board. Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air. ""The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,""  says Mr Pathak, adding that ""sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government"". According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology. ""National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,"" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, ""now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase"". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling."
China US,Shock in Cameroon as 74-year-old opposition firebrand dies in detention,2025-12-01T17:38:50.481Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9204y4w5o,"Left-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced. Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election. Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. . No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied. According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend. ""We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,"" he said. He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary. Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details. ""The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,"" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October. Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party. He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death. Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as ""the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame"" that burned for democratic emancipation. Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation. ""One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,"" Muna said. According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection. ""He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,"" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as ""illegal"". In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and . His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online. Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces. Ekane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate. Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate. At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN. This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were ""firing at point-blank range at the people"". The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing."
China US,Vicar leads push to honour Chinese WW1 labourers,2025-11-11T06:14:45.180Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g2kz3rn6o,"A British-Chinese vicar is leading an effort to get the contribution of 140,000 Chinese labourers who helped the Allies in World War One formally remembered at St Paul's Cathedral. The Reverend Mark Nam, of St John the Evangelist in Woodley, Berkshire, first learned about the Chinese Labour Corps in an online talk during the Covid pandemic and needs £15,000 for the memorial. He said it was now his ""passion… so that my children's children see there were people like us, of Chinese heritage, who stood shoulder to shoulder with British troops at their hour of need"". The men were recruited from the Chinese province of Shandong to do manual work behind the frontlines from 1916. Mr Nam attended the online talk by the , which promotes Chinese culture with the aim of fostering better understanding between people of Chinese origin and those from other ethnic backgrounds, both in the UK and worldwide. ""As I started listening, oh my gosh, something was rising up in me,"" he said. ""I just didn't know about [the men]. By the end, I felt moved to action. ""A lot of people in this group are quite elderly. Hearing one gentleman say 'I hope I can see something established before I die' really touched me."" Having publicised the project online, he was approached by the cathedral and Mr Nam said an earmarked place for the memorial is an impressive spot. ""I thought it might be down a corridor, by the toilets or something,"" he said. ""It's within almost touching distance of Lord Nelson's tomb. It's great we have got the place. ""I suppose that is the easy bit. The hard bit is that I have to pay for it. ""I'm a parish priest, a vicar. I don't have money sloshing around in my cassock."" He is raising funds online to pay for the memorial, which he said would mark the men's contributions appropriately. ""I'm British-Chinese and Britain is my home and I want to see something on our shores,"" he added. ""France and Belgium have had memorials for several years and I would love to see Britain catch up and do this properly."""
China US,Our dogs' diversity can be traced back to the Stone Age,2025-11-13T19:00:29.556Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7j89ykro,"If you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable. But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought. ""When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,"" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study. She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago. In a paper , this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution. They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives. This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads. Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age. ""It's really surprising,"" she said. ""And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this."" Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle. This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication. Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food. Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near. As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: ""It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see. ""It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one."" For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In , a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China. They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years. I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back."

But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a ""sudden correction"" in global financial markets, saying ""market valuations appear stretched"" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that ""there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now"". Asked whether from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us."" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these ""inflection points"": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. ""Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence."" But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is ""palpably exciting"" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: ""It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… ""So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: ""restricted"". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term ""AI factories"" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: ""I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!"" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: ""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough."" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. ""I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,"" he said. But he also said: ""What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure."" Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. ""I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,"" he told me. ""Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it."" But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: ""truth matters"". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? ""I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,"" he adds. ""I think that will have consequences."" Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about ""irrational exuberance"". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century."
China US,From florist to drone maker: How the weapon became so mainstream,2025-11-14T22:24:18.224Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3ydv2ygro,"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is often described as the world's ""first drone war"". It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements. Now, she makes drones for use against the Russians. ""It was just an obvious decision for me,"" she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. ""I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military."" Ms Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed. ""I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones,"" she recalled. ""So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them."" These days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon. Combat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact. Before 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones. ""This has been the first full-blown drone war,"" says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare. ""There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They've become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians."" And not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan. ""You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power."" Ms Pettyjohn says. The world's biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Europe, Portugal's Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany's Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due in Swindon in southwest England at the end of November. Meanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be on new military drones. ""The sector is growing really quickly,"" said Mike Armstrong, Stark's managing director for the UK. ""I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we've seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon."" The growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down. Anti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport. Oleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company. ""We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones,"" he says. Since 2022, DroneShield's share price has ""We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us,"" Mr Vornik adds. As well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China's use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs. Munin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army. ""We're building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones,"" he says. ""It's a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it's coming in."" Experts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI). At the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger. But Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. ""That is going to be the next real shift. ""Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate."" In the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line. ""I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers. ""But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture."""
China US,Funeral company to move after business premises sold,2025-11-20T05:58:43.627Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4xldplr4o,"A village's funeral director said he had been ""shocked"" after learning his leased premises had been sold without his knowledge. Richard Stebbings Funeral Service, which has operated in Impington, Cambridgeshire, for 21 years, has been purchased by a council-owned company. This Land, owned by Cambridge County Council, bought the family-run business alongside a village shop in the hope of building 28 apartments on the site. Mr Stebbings said the change ""just came as a shock"" and said he now does not ""know what to do or where to go"". This Land said it proposed to deliver a ""sustainable residential-led development"" to include 28 apartments, a retail unit, landscaping, and amenity space. A spokesperson for the business said: ""Discussions with the two current commercial tenants on the site remain ongoing and it is our aim to retain a productive dialogue with them as the plans for the site progress."" Mr Stebbings, who started working in the profession in 1966, said: ""We had a meeting and we thought we were still part of what was happening, but unfortunately we weren't. ""They said, 'I am afraid you are going to have to go' and I am just completely lost now."" This Land on Cambridgeshire County Council-owned land in 2016, but is yet to turn a profit. The authority has had to play down fears over about £120m it has loaned This Land. The business said it recognised ""the important role"" the funeral company had in the community and said it was ""committed to working closely with them as they explore options for the future of their businesses"". Mr Stebbings said he had received lots of support from his customers. ""Everything has to be done in a dignified way when you're caring for somebody's loved one - they need to be treated with respect."""
China US,Typhoon moves away from Philippines after killing two,2025-11-10T03:16:42.357Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykp36ewkzo,"A weakened Typhoon Fung-wong is now passing over the South China Sea and expected to head to Taiwan, after leaving two people dead in the Philippines. Some 1.4 million in the Philippines had been preemptively evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall on Sunday as a super typhoon, carrying winds of 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). It hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT) and weakened to a typhoon hours later. Fung-wong comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left nearly 200 people dead. Philippine authorities are reporting less severe damage than expected - though a number of communities are still cut off by the floods. By daybreak, the winds from Typhoon Fung-wong which had howled all night had died down, and people came out to see the damage. There was plenty of damage to buildings, but good preparation appears to have prevented a repeat of the casualties seen after Kalmaegi hit the central Philippines last week. The country's meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and ""high risk of life-threatening"" storm surges from the ""very intense"" typhoon. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, buildings were secured and residents in low-lying and coastal areas had been urged to move to higher ground. At a shelter in central Aurora, parents brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. ""We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,"" Jessa Zurbano had earlier told the BBC. Another evacuee Patry Azul said: ""Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe."" The winds Fung-wong brought were not as strong as in some previous storms, and its destructive power quickly weakened after it made landfall. Two deaths were reported, according to the civil defence office: one person drowned, while another woman was found dead under debris in Catbalogan City. Two others were injured. Still, many neighbourhoods have been flooded, and some are now isolated from the rest of the country after roads and bridges were cut by the high water levels. Aurora officials told local media on Monday that four towns have been blocked. Power is down in much of the main island of Luzon. The Filipino government had declared a state of calamity across the country in preparation for Typhoon Fung-wong and in the wake of Kalmaegi. This gives government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services. Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year, left at least 204 people dead in the Philippines, while more than 100 are missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones. About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide. However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - . That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding. Are you in the Philippines? If so you can"
China US,Guinness maker appoints former Tesco boss to stem flagging sales,2025-11-10T13:53:50.155Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4021v7wepo,"A former Tesco boss has been appointed to the top job at Guinness-owner Diageo, as the biggest drinks firm in the world seeks to turn around its flagging sales. Sir Dave Lewis will take over the brewing giant on 1 January, after former chief executive Debra Crew quit in the summer after two years in charge. The firm has been battling weaker sales across its range despite a growth in Guinness sales, with shares recently falling to a 10-year low. Following the announcement of Sir Dave's appointment on Monday, Diageo's share price rose 7% in early trading. Diageo owns well-known brands including Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Captain Morgan rum, but has seen sales weakening in key markets, in particular the US and China. Sir Dave was chief executive of Tesco for six years until 2020, and before that had spent nearly 30 years at consumer goods giant Unilever. He will leave his current role as chairman of health firm Haleon. Diageo said its board felt Sir Dave had extensive chief executive experience and proven leadership skills ""that is right for Diageo at this time"". ""The market faces some headwinds but there are also significant opportunities,"" said Sir Dave. ""I look forward to working with the team to face these challenges and realise some of the opportunities in a way which creates shareholder value."" Diageo saw its operating profits decline to £3.2bn in the year to June - around 28% lower compared with the same period the year before - with net sales down 0.1%. It said there was ""clearly much more to do"" in what it called a challenging year, citing ""pressure on consumers"". Last week, Diageo forecast net sales growth would be flat to slightly down in the year ahead due to a ""weaker US consumer environment"" and lower sales across China. Rising inflation has led to people tightening their spending in recent times, with consumers cutting back on drinking and eating out. The firm has also been battling with changing drinking habits from younger people, who are opting to drink less alcohol than previous generations. ""Dave Lewis needs to put Diageo back on track quickly,"" said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. ""His style is to listen closely to customers and suppliers and work out what's gone wrong. The focus will be on repair work, not long-term growth."" Mr Coatsworth said the new boss earned the nicknam ""Drastic Dave"" while at Unilever ""because of his ability to make bold decisions without simply tinkering at the edges"". ""At Tesco, he walked away after saying his job to stabilise the business was done, rather than sticking around to take the business to the next level. One might suggest the same approach will apply to Diageo."" Sir Dave will replace Nik Jhangiani - Diageo's chief financial officer who has been acting as interim chief executive since Ms Crew resigned in July."
China US,Mick Jagger makes surprise visit to his old school,2025-11-19T18:36:55.535Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3k3wejkkvo,"Sir Mick Jagger has advised the next generation of musicians to ""work really hard and not give up"" during a surprise visit to his former school. The Rolling Stones frontman visited The Mick Jagger Centre at Dartford Grammar School in Kent on Wednesday to mark the facility's 25th anniversary. The 82-year-old thanked music teachers at the performing arts centre who ""inspired children and young people in their musical careers"". Sir Mick told the BBC that young people aiming for a music career needed ""a lot of luck"" and to ""work really hard at it and not give up"". He said that ""music wasn't much of a career"" when he was growing up, but added: ""That all changed very, very quickly in the early 60s and I got on that bandwagon."" He opened The Mick Jagger Centre, home to the Dartford Music School and Dartford Symphony Orchestra, in 2000. The centre launched a programme of events in October to mark its 25th anniversary. Sir Mick said that visiting his former school ""brings back a lot of memories and it's nice to see the kids seem happy"". According to The Mick Jagger Centre, the singer funds its Red Rooster project offering free music tuition, including in local primary schools. ""If you can express yourself through song, drama, art, dance – all these things are important,"" Sir Mick added. ""My involvement's been honestly pretty minimal in a real way, but I do feel connected to it, and I think all the people involved with it have done a really wonderful job."" The school's headmaster, Julian Metcalf, said Sir Mick's return visit was ""very special and the icing on the cake"". ""He completely proved wrong that old adage that you should never meet your heroes. What a genuinely lovely guy,"" he told BBC Radio Kent. Mr Metcalf said Sir Mick watched a pupil concert - which ""he loved"" - and later performed on stage with students. ""It was unbelievable to watch,"" said the headteacher. ""You can take the boy out of Dartford, but you can never take the Dartford out of the boy. He has kept a real interest in Kent, Dartford and what is going on in the school."" Sir Mick first met The Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards on a platform at Dartford station, forming a friendship that would lead to the band's formation in 1962. The town has several streets named after The Rolling Stones songs, including Little Red Walk, Angie Mews and Ruby Tuesday Drive."
China US,Google boss says trillion-dollar AI investment boom has 'elements of irrationality',2025-11-18T12:16:04.197Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo,"Every company would be affected if the AI bubble were to burst, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet has told the BBC. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an ""extraordinary moment"", there was some ""irrationality"" in the current AI boom. It comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry. Asked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning. ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us,"" he said. In a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment, , and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs. The interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense. Alphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI. A particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation. As valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment. It has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed. This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds. In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of ""irrational exuberance"" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can ""overshoot"" in investment cycles like this. ""We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,"" he said. ""I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry . But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own ""full stack"" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence. The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was , committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years. Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop ""state of the art"" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London. For the first time, he said Google would ""over time"" take a step that is being pushed for in government to ""train our models"" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI ""superpower"" after the US and China. ""We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,"" Mr Pichai said. However, he also warned about the ""immense"" energy needs of AI, which made up , according to the International Energy Agency. Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,"" he said. He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies. ""The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,"" he said. AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it ""the most profound technology"" humankind had worked on. ""We will have to work through societal disruptions,"" he said, adding that it would also ""create new opportunities"". ""It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,"" he said. Those who do adapt to AI ""will do better"". ""It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor.

China US,Profits fall at IT firm Kainos despite rising revenue and global expansion,2025-11-10T11:00:19.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4zz47ew0o,"IT firm Kainos, one of Northern Ireland's largest businesses, has made £32m in pre-tax profit in the first half of the financial year. Although revenues rose to £196.1m, increased costs from national insurance rises, investments and temporary staffing reduced profits by 16% on the previous year. The company is set to take four floors of the £40m office building currently under construction at Bankmore Square as its new headquarters, due to open in September 2027. Kainos employs more than 3,100 people globally, offering digital services to large institutional clients like public bodies and the NHS, as well as finance and HR products in partnership with US firm Workday. AI is the hottest topic in both technology and financial markets, with the value of individual companies in the sector . Kainos CEO Brendan Mooney told BBC News NI that AI was already an important part of the company's own operations. ""That's everything from how we do our software engineering to how we are able to do prototyping for clients in ever quicker timeframes. Some 65% of what we do on the engineering side is now supported by AI tools and we see productivity improvements around that."" While a lot of tools for clients are still at the ""experimentation"" stage, some narrower AI tools have already been rolled out by the company, including a chat bot for Leeds City Council intended to provide guidance for those in financial distress. Other clients, dealing with sensitive data or live systems, are more hesitant. ""Some of our clients will be the likes of the Home Office, the Passport Service, the Ministry of Defence. Some clients, I think rightfully, are cautious about - you give the model your data, there's no guarantee you get it back or it doesn't go somewhere else."" Forty-three percent of the company's half year revenue came from its international operations, with 120 new employees in Canada and entry to new markets in Australia and New Zealand. Brendan Mooney said that trend is likely to continue. ""At our current pace, in two years' time, the majority of our business will be generated elsewhere – even while our UK business grows as well. The opportunities are global for what we do."" Another key growth area for the company is in the health care sector. Revenues from the health sector increased by 33% to £29.6m with the company providing services to research bodies, as well as the NHS. With the Chancellor announcing as one of her priorities ahead of the Autumn Statement, there is likely to be an increased focus on boosting productivity and digital accessibility in the health service."
China US,AI firm claims Chinese spies used its tech to automate cyber attacks,2025-11-14T12:16:51.557Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lzmygr84o,"The makers of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Claude claim to have caught hackers sponsored by the Chinese government using the tool to perform automated cyber attacks against around 30 global organisations. Anthropic said hackers tricked the chatbot into carrying out automated tasks under the guise of carrying out cyber security research. The company this was the ""first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign"". But sceptics are questioning the accuracy of that claim - and the motive behind it. Anthropic said it discovered the hacking attempts in mid-September. Pretending they were legitimate cyber security workers, hackers gave the chatbot small automated tasks which, when strung together, formed a ""highly sophisticated espionage campaign"". Researchers at Anthropic said they had ""high confidence"" the people carrying out the attacks were ""a Chinese state-sponsored group"". They said humans chose the targets - large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies – but the company would not be more specific. Hackers then built an unspecified programme using Claude's coding assistance to ""autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement"". Anthropic claims the chatbot was able to successfully breach various unnamed organisations, extract sensitive data and sort through it for valuable information. The company said it had since banned the hackers from using the chatbot and had notified affected companies and law enforcement. But Martin Zugec from cyber firm Bitdefender said the cyber security world had mixed feelings about the news. ""Anthropic's report makes bold, speculative claims but doesn't supply verifiable threat intelligence evidence,"" he said. ""Whilst the report does highlight a growing area of concern, it's important for us to be given as much information as possible about how these attacks happen so that we can assess and define the true danger of AI attacks."" Anthropic's announcement is perhaps the most high profile example of companies claiming bad actors are using AI tools to carry out automated hacks. It is the kind of danger many have been worried about, but other AI companies have also claimed that nation state hackers have used their products. In February 2024, OpenAI published a blog post in collaboration with cyber experts from Microsoft saying it had disrupted five state-affiliated actors, including some from China. ""These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,"" . Anthropic has not said how it concluded the hackers in this latest campaign were linked to the Chinese government. The Chinese embassy in the US told reporters it was not involved. It comes as some cyber security companies have been criticised for over-hyping cases where AI was used by hackers. Critics say the technology is still too unwieldy to be used for automated cyber attacks. In November, cyber experts at Google which highlighted growing concerns about AI being used by hackers to create brand new forms of malicious software. But the paper concluded the tools were not all that successful - and were only in a testing phase. The cyber security industry, like the AI business, is keen to say hackers are using the tech to target companies in order to boost the interest in their own products. In its blog post, Anthropic argued that the answer to stopping AI attackers is to use AI defenders. ""The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defence,"" the company claimed. And Anthropic admitted its chatbot made mistakes. For example, it made up fake login usernames and passwords and claimed to have extracted secret information which was in fact publicly available. ""This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,"" Anthropic said. to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. ."
China US,"Russian spy ship pointed lasers at RAF pilots tracking it, says UK",2025-11-19T19:07:00.819Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24028k7edo,"A Russian spy ship has used lasers for the first time to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters, the defence secretary has said. John Healey told reporters the ""deeply dangerous"" move from the Yantar was being taken ""extremely seriously"" by the government. He added that the vessel was north of Scotland and had entered UK waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks. The UK would continue monitoring the ship and had ""military options ready should the Yantar change course,"" he added. ""My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,"" he added. Healey said the laser incident took place whilst the Yantar was being followed by a Royal Navy frigate and RAF Poseidon P-8 planes deployed to ""track the vessel's every move"". It is understood the episode occurred within the last two weeks. Speaking at a news conference in Downing Street, the defence secretary added he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely ""when it is in our wider waters"". Healey said the vessel, which entered service in 2015, was part of Russia's Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), which was designed to ""undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict"". ""We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,"" he said. Asked about the risks posed by lasers, Healey replied: ""Anything that impedes, disrupts or puts at risk pilots in charge of British military planes is deeply dangerous."" The Russian Embassy released a statement, saying it was ""not interested in British underwater communications"". ""The actions of our country do not touch interests of the UK and they are not aimed at undermining its security,"" the statement said. It added: ""However, London, with its Russophobic path and increasing militaristic hysteria leads to further degradation European security, providing the premise for new dangerous situations. ""We call on the British side to hold off taking any destructive steps which might aggravate the crisis situation on the European continent."" Labour MP Matt Western, who chairs the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, said: ""Today's news demonstrates once again that Russia presents a genuine and immediate threat to the UK's security."" He added: ""I welcome the seriousness with which the defence secretary is treating this issue, but there is more we can do. More assertive retaliation may be required."" The defence secretary previously about the Yantar after it was spotted in UK waters in January, calling it ""another example of growing Russian aggression"". According to the ship tracking website Marine Traffic, the ship has not broadcast its location since 2 November, and was last tracked in the Baltic Sea north of the Latvian Coast. On 6 November, the Dutch Navy said two of its vessels escorted the Yantar out of the North Sea, where it was operating near Dutch territorial waters. While the Yantar's current position is not clear, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows an RAF Poseidon P-8 surveillance plane circling off the Scottish coast, although it is not certain that this is tracking the Yantar. Russia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables. Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American security think tank, said the Yantar's use of lasers was ""an escalation for sure"". ""Essentially, you do it to impede the pilots from doing their work,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""We don't know exactly how strong the lasers were, but even if they didn't blind the pilots, it was provocative,"" she added. The UK and its Nato allies are to offshore cables, pipelines and other infrastructure critical to internet connectivity. In his speech, the defence secretary warned about Russian incursions into Nato airspace, as well as the threats posed by China and armed conflicts around the world, adding: ""Our world is changing. It is less predictable. It is more dangerous."" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has come under for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack. The committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal. Healey said the UK government ""takes a different view"" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato. But he said the committee was ""right to say"" Britain should ""pick up the pace of our commitment"" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year. The report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme . The Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month. Healey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not ""at any price"", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part. It has been reported that the EU is demanding an entry fee running to billions of euros before the UK can take part. He added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be ""good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry""."
China US,At least 65 dead and hundreds missing after fire engulfs Hong Kong tower blocks,2025-11-27T12:52:42.992Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg165d7ppvo,"At least 65 people have been killed in a huge fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong - the city's deadliest blaze in more than 70 years. Some residents remain trapped inside the buildings, with more than 270 people unaccounted for, while 70 people are injured. Hundreds of firefighters have been tackling the blaze, which is now largely under control at all of the affected buildings at Wang Fuk Court. The housing complex had been undergoing extensive renovations when the fire began. The exact cause is unclear but police say materials on outside of the buildings may have facilitated its spread. Three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. The blaze broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, with flames and thick clouds of grey smoke seen billowing from the towers, dominating the city's skyline. By 18:22 local time, officials upgraded the fire to a level five - the most serious category. Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among those killed in the blaze. He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost. Ten other firefighters are also injured, according to the fire department. ""I am devastated,"" 65-year-old Jason Kong told news agency Reuters. ""I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do."" He said a neighbour had called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris and the risk posed from collapsing scaffolding, has hampered rescue efforts, but the fire department has so far rescued 55 people. ""Despite the complex conditions at the scene, the firefighters' rescue efforts will not stop,"" Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee told a news conference on Thursday evening. Mesh material and plastic sheets which were found on the outside of the buildings are not believed to be fireproof, while Styrofoam was also found on the buildings' windows. These materials may have allowed the fire to spread faster, police said. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" a police spokesperson said. Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption has said it will launch a criminal investigation over the renovation works. Fire safety expert Prof Jiang Liming, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said he believed the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks may have also helped the fire grow. Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight across Hong Kong - a city known for its high-rise buildings - and is widely used in construction. Lee said he had arranged inspections of ""all housing estates undergoing major repairs"" to check the ""safety of scaffolding and building materials"". He added that the government was considering a review of bamboo scaffolding and whether they should be replaced by metal frameworks. ""The government will stand united with all Hong Kong people, and we are confident that we will be able to get through this together,"" he said. Campaigning for the city's Legislative Council election on 7 December has been suspended. Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po district was built in 1983 and consists of eight tower blocks providing 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built. Some residents told local media that alarms did not sound when the fire began, and that they struggled to leave when the elevators stopped working. Kiko Ma, 33, who has an apartment in the housing complex, told the BBC that some of the fire alarms had been turned off during the renovation, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to enter and exit the buildings. There were also reports on Wednesday night of blasts being heard from inside the buildings, and of fire hoses struggling to reach the upper levels of the 31-storey towers. Police have evacuated nearby buildings, and several temporary shelters have been opened. One of the shelters, located across the road from the housing complex, was deemed unsafe as the fire raged, and evacuees were directed to another further away. Outside one of the shelters, a woman was seen holding her daughter's graduation photo as she searched for her family. ""She and her father are still not out yet,"" the 52-year-old told Reuters. ""They didn't have water to save our building."" An officer at a temporary shelter earlier told news agency AFP that it was unclear how many people were unaccounted for because residents were still trickling in late into the night to report missing family members. As dawn broke on Thursday morning, small fires remained visible from the outside of the still-smouldering buildings. Meanwhile, people have been turning up with food and clothes for displaced residents. Several well-known Chinese businesses have pledged donations to support relief efforts. Alibaba Group, which owns e-commerce platforms Temu and Taobao, said it would give HK$20 million ($2.6m; £1.9m). There is a large evacuation zone around the fire, roads are closed and more than 30 bus routes have been diverted, Hong Kong's Transport Department says. Thirteen nearby schools have suspended lessons, education officials said. China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported. Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record happened in 1948, which killed 176 people and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse."
China US,On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet,2025-11-19T00:23:14.958Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91dk0l50no,"Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker. ""Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over."" Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt. ""I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,"" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin. This is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet""; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports. After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance. Some ""shadow"" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or ""spoofing"" their location data. Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of ""shadow"" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically ""floating rust buckets"", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, ""good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost"". Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: ""There's no secret made about it."" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as ""false"". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called , but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection. Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point ""where they just don't even bother at all"", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages. Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air that ""shadow"" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. While politicians , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea. The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it. Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event. ""There's a complexity associated with it,"" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. ""With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis."" The Estonians speak from experience. When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has ""constantly"" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk. The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken. ""Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,"" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, ""we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself"". ""Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies."" Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up. ""Thank you for your co-operation,"" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia. The exchange lasted just over five minutes. ""You need to see it in a larger perspective,"" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: ""This information can be used in our maritime surveillance."" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: ""You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels."" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile ""the dark fleet is getting darker"". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's ""anti-Russian sanctions"" were ""illegitimate"" and ""undermine established principles of global commerce"". ""Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,"" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to ""easily resolved"" issues such as administrative delays. It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had ""heightened"" the risks by ""forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape""."
China US,"'I worked, I paid taxes - then the bank took my home'",2025-11-19T03:39:23.284Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jz321x14o,"""I am waiting for the bailiff to knock on the door, take my keys and kick me out,"" says Jose Da Costa Diogo, one of thousands of people who have been told this year their homes will be repossessed. The 65-year-old learned he would lose his home in Thetford, Norfolk, during a brisk 10-minute county court hearing earlier this year. The interest-only mortgage on the three-bedroom property was taken out more than 20 years ago in the hope he and his then wife would save up enough to eventually cover the capital sum. But the collapse of the marriage and his ex-wife's departure to Brazil in 2015, left Mr Da Costa Diogo unable to repay the £80,000 still outstanding. And because his ex-wife was still on both the mortgage documents and the property deeds, he was also unable to sell the property to cover the outstanding amount. ""I tried to do the right thing and carried on paying all the bills,"" he said. ""After 25 years, I have nothing to show... but I still have to carry on living. ""I'm going to be homeless."" Court figures - the highest number in five years. Experts say the rise is down to a variety of factors and the rise in the general cost of living. Mr Da Costa Diogo registered as homeless with Breckland Council, his local authority. He is far from alone. The BBC asked every English council with housing responsibilities how many people presented as homeless as a result of a mortgage repossession. The number has doubled, according to the 240 councils that provided comparable data - from 1,517 in 2022-23, to 2,370 in 2023-24. It was 3,406 in the most recent year. People in local government say rehoming those affected by repossessions is putting ever greater stress on council resources. Tom Hunt, who chairs the Local Government Association's Inclusive Growth Board, said: ""As more and more people turn to their council for help, local authorities are having to stretch budgets further. ""The temporary accommodation crisis facing councils is only worsening."" Lucy Davies sees the devastation repossessions can have on a daily basis. A housing law advisor with the Suffolk Law Centre, she volunteers her expertise to those in need at courts in Suffolk and Essex. ""I see the sheer number of people that this is affecting,"" said Ms Davies. ""People get into difficulties largely through no fault of their own. ""Quite often there's mental health, there's employment issues, there's family issues, and I think it can very quickly spiral out of control."" On the day the BBC joined Ms Davies for a day at Ipswich County Court, where she volunteers with the Ipswich County Court Advice and Representation Service, none of the five people facing mortgage repossession cases turned up. This, she said, was often a symptom of shame, despair and the sense that losing one's home is a foregone conclusion. ""It is quite frightening coming to court, but it doesn't have to be."" She urged people to seek advice as soon as possible and said the cases she was seeing were becoming ""more entrenched or more serious"". People were finding it increasingly difficult to access housing legal aid, she explained. Paul Gorton, of The Law Society's housing law committee, agreed. He said a historic lack of investment in legal aid meant fewer and fewer law firms were able to offer legal aid housing advice. ""Many people are too well off to be eligible for legal aid but cannot afford to pay for legal advice themselves,"" Mr Gorton said. ""We have both legal aid provider deserts and restrictive eligibility criteria leaving many people stuck in limbo."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it had recently announced ""the first major funding increase for housing legal aid in three decades - a 24% rise"". ""This investment will help ensure effective access to justice for some of the most vulnerable in our society, while supporting a more stable and sustainable legal aid sector,"" the spokesperson said. Seeking to repossess a home is ""always a last resort"" for lenders, said Karina Hutchins, a principal in the mortgage policy team at UK Finance, a trade association for the banking and financial services sector. She said while the number of mortgage repossessions had been creeping up in recent years, the current levels remained ""historically low"". ""Repossessions are really, really uncommon."" She said in the first quarter of 2025, about 2,000 homes were repossessed compared with 13,000 in the same quarter of 2009, in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. ""I can imagine that customers are really worried and distressed if they're facing financial difficulty, but they don't have to go through it alone,"" Ms Hutchins said. ""The earlier they get in touch with their mortgage lender, the more support and help that that lender can give them and the more likelihood they have of getting back up to date with their mortgage."" Options offered by lenders, she said, included reduced mortgage payments to allow time to get back on track, budgeting and other tools to understand ""their full financial situation"" and advice about debt charities and support organisations. Henry Sabati McRae, who lives in Croydon, south London, has so far managed to stave off repossession. A software developer by training, Mr McRae's financial woes came in the wake of the death of a brother in 2020 and his mother in October 2023. Since October 2024, the 51-year-old has been out of work and, despite applying for hundreds of jobs, he has not managed to get a new contract. ""It doesn't matter how much you have in savings,"" he said. ""Within a few months it is wiped out. I managed to stretch it as far as I could, because I'd been quite conservative with how I was doing."" Even so, the mortgage arrears on his two-bedroom flat eventually grew to about £13,000 and his bank said if that figure was not reduced to below £8,000 it would seek to repossess his home. ""The most important thing for me at that time, and I think for anybody, was keeping the roof over my head,"" he said. ""Otherwise it spirals out of control."" To scrape by, he has turned to selling off his possessions on an internet auction site and accepting a loan from a friend. Like many of those facing repossession action the BBC has spoken to, Mr McRae said the experience was deeply ""humiliating"" and that his instincts were initially ""to draw the curtains shut"". However, he said realising he was far from alone and in speaking about it has helped him plot out, like an IT problem, his ""solution to it"". Businessman Mike Williams, who lives 10 miles (16km) south of Mr McRae in Caterham, Surrey, has also avoided repossession. He took on the mortgage of his self-build home after he and his wife separated. In three years, repayments on the interest-only loan, which was taken out 20 years ago, have tripled. He says it has left him with ""next to no disposable income"". At court, he renegotiated a repayment plan which would add an extra 20% to his monthly payments. In five years, when the mortgage comes to term, he intends to sell the two-bedroom house which he and his wife built from the ground up. ""It has quite a bit of sentimental value to me, so yes it is heart-wrenching,"" he said. As for Mr Da Costa Diogo, his bank has repossessed the property. In the same month it was repossessed, the BBC saw a similar three-bedroom property in the same Thetford street as Mr Da Costa Diogo's on the market for £160,000 - almost double the amount he owed. Within hours of losing his home, he was given emergency accommodation in a small ground-floor studio in north Suffolk.

China US,"Mass killings probe in Sudan will hold culprits to account, vows UN",2025-11-14T17:24:51.089Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jd4elgwzo,"The UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher. ""Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,"" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher. The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies  ""fuelling and profiting"" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Speaking on Friday, Türk said: ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population."" The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups."
China US,How a 'fertility gap' is fuelling the rise of one-child families,2025-12-05T14:39:45.809Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyv7211jljo,"""It was nice to hear someone giving it a name,"" she says. She and her husband have a five-year-old daughter called Joanie but they knew they probably wouldn't have a second child - not because they couldn't, but not out of choice, either: Natalie finds it hard to imagine having the time and money for one. ""You know you'd love that baby, everyone tells you, but there's a little teeny niggle where you think, 'what if I put my first in that position where she can't do the activity she wants to do because I've got to spread money out between two'?"" She adds: ""Is it okay to say you're only having one because they don't fit into modern ways of parenting?"" Modern parenting, for Natalie, 35, looks like family holidays with Joanie. It looks like weekday evenings hearing about her day at school and helping her with homework. But, with demanding jobs and no family living nearby to help with childcare, it also looks like an expensive childcare jigsaw. But ultimately, deciding whether or not to have a second is a tough decision. ""I think you worry you'd regret it,"" she says. The fertility rate was 1.41 children per woman in England and Wales last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest on record for a third year running. Separately, the proportion of families with one dependent child has grown since the turn of the century - that includes families with one child, as well as those who also have children over 18 or may have left home. They made up 44% of all families in England and Wales with dependent children living with them, up from 42% in 2000. (Though the peak was 47% in the early 2010s, which then dipped before picking up again after Covid.) The UK's falling birth rate is part of what the United Nations calls a ""global fertility slump"", which it puts down, in part, to money worries. People aren't ""turning their backs on parenthood"", says the UN in a summary of its Population Fund's State of World Population report, which surveyed people across 14 countries. Instead it says they ""are being denied the freedom to start families due to skyrocketing living costs, persistent gender inequality and deepening uncertainty about the future"". Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said earlier this year that she wants ""more young people to have children, if they so choose"". She pointed to the expansion of funded childcare hours in England as a way the government was trying to recover ""dashed dreams"". Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England did fall this year for the first time in 15 years, . They are now an average of £12,425, down 22% on the previous year. However they are slightly up in Scotland and Wales, at £12,468 and £15,038 respectively. A study from University College London (UCL) last year suggested two-fifths of 32-year-olds in England want children – or more children, if they are already parents – but only one in four of them are actively trying to conceive. Dr Paula Sheppard, an anthropologist at the University of Oxford, believes parents in the West still think of having two children as ""the norm"". However, she says there is a ""fertility gap"" and that ""for every three kids wanted… only two are born"". ""A lot of this gap is driven by… people starting families later and later in life,"" she explains – often a result of education and career opportunities for women and changing gender roles. ""It becomes a whole lot more difficult to get pregnant [and] it becomes a whole lot more difficult to keep the pregnancy."" The falling birthrate is giving education policymakers a headache. The number of pupils in England has dropped by 150,000 since 2019, and will fall by a further 400,000 by the end of the decade, according to the Education Policy Institute. Schools are given money per pupil, so fewer pupils means less cash. Less cash, in turn, is an issue for those head teachers struggling to fund staffing and resources. About a year ago, a post on a UK Reddit thread for teachers raised what one contributor saw as another potential impact of more only children on the education system. The contributor wrote that they had seen a rise in ""spoilt"" children with ""demanding behaviour due to overindulgent parenting"". These children tended to have siblings who were much older or no siblings at all, they claimed. The idea that children without siblings may be selfish or spoiled dates back to research conducted in the late 19th century by psychologists G Stanley Hall and E W Bohannon. ""Selfishness is one of the most striking traits of the only children in families,"" they wrote in their Study of Peculiar and Exceptional Children. ""'The only child' is deficient on the social side."" But more recent studies have debunked that idea. ""Numerous studies have disproven these myths that only children are maladjusted, spoiled, and lonely,"" explains Dr Adriean Mancillas, a psychologist and professor in California State University's education department. Dr Mancillas has spent her career exploring family dynamics, the development of only children, and mental health intervention in schools - and says most research ""consistently demonstrates advantages of being an only child, particularly in educational and academic outcomes"". This is down, mainly, to a theory called ""resource dilution"". In simple terms, she says this means parents with one child ""are able to be more involved in their child's education"". ""Children with siblings share in parents' time, emotional support, attention, and financial resources whereas the only child does not,"" says Dr Mancillas. ""This singular focus of resources tends to provide academic advantages for the only child."" She points to some research that suggests many only children did better academically when schools closed to most pupils in lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, ""because of the relative availability of parental resources"". ""Resource dilution"" is one of three social science theories about the consequences of being an only child, according to University College London (UCL) academics. The second is ""confluence theory"", which also suggests that only children perform better than children with siblings academically because a family's ""intellectual environment"" declines as the number of children grows. Then there is ""socialisation theory"" which, in contrast, argues that siblings help children learn how to share, negotiate and resolve conflict. Existing research, according to the UCL academics, support the first two theories. But, like Dr Mancillas, they say it ""generally does not support the socialisation theory as it finds that only children are comparable to children with siblings (especially those with few siblings) in terms of personality, parent-child relationships, achievement, motivation and personal adjustment"". Dr Mancillas suggests there could be something else feeding into only children's better academic performance, too. ""Studies show that parents with one child tend to have attained higher educational outcomes themselves than parents of multiple children,"" she says. ""Much of the time, parents have delayed having children in order to complete career or higher educational goals. This would suggest that parents who have one child likely place a high value on education overall."" Earlier this year, Susan Newman, an American psychologist explored so-called only-child dynasties - where parents who are only-children, have one child themselves - in an article to accompany her new book, Just One: The New Science, Secrets & Joy of Parenting an Only Child. One of the most surprising findings from the new research for her book was, she wrote: ""Adult only-children are increasingly choosing to have ""just one"" child themselves. ""The resulting only-child dynasties underscore the trend. Count on seeing more of them, most noticeably without the spoiled, entitled 'little emperors' we heard so much about for so long -despite a lack of evidence to support such misinformed stereotypes."" The phrase has been used as shorthand to describe the only children born under China's one-child policy, the idea held by some being that it led to a generation of ""solitary children pampered and paraded with a retinue of parents and elders"". However, while the policy did leave a lasting legacy after its end in 2015 - an ageing population, for example, and a gender imbalance because of a traditional preference for male children - research has suggested that the ""little emperor effect"" has not been a part of it. There were ""very few only-child effects"" on children's personality, according to a study of Chinese schoolchildren carried out by American researchers at two Texas Universities. The phrase ""one and done"" was only just beginning to emerge when New York-based journalist Lauren Sandler began writing her 2013 book, One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One. ""I would be on the subway with my adorable child and someone would say, 'so cute, when are you having another one?' ""There is so little discussion about what it means to have single children, which is incredible to me considering how many there are."" She adds: ""I think that people feel very alone in this."" She began to question why some people assumed she would want more children, something she also explored for her work. It used to be that having larger families was how we survived, she points out. ""A family was a workforce, and that was very much a necessity until the industrial revolution."" Only after the industrial revolution, and the introduction of child labour and welfare laws did that change. ""The opportunity costs and the economic costs of children shifted dramatically,"" she explains. She also questioned the negative connotations that can sometimes be associated with having one child. ""There's also a lot of research that shows that only children do not take relationships for granted at a very, very young age. So, [it's not the same as when you] fight with your older brother and then just, through exposure, need to make up again. ""These people aren't going to be at the dinner table with you every night. Because of that, there's a lot of care that seems to come into relationships. And so that is sort of the opposite of the selfish stereotype of only children."" So teachers may not really have a generation of ""little emperors"" on their hands. But the is still very much being felt by some schools, and more widely too. Policymakers, for example, are grappling with the impact of the UK's ageing population on public services, taxes, and the growing cost of state pensions. ""Falling birth rates and an ageing population can create pressures on public services and public finances because the balance between the number of people working and the number of people drawing on age-related services changes over time,"" says Dr Alina Pelikh of University College London, who specialises in demography. ""Governments may need to consider adjustments - whether through pension age, contributions, or other measures - to ensure long-term sustainability."" The concerns are global, and governments around the world are trying to encourage people to have more children. US President Donald Trump has mentioned the idea of a $5,000 ""baby bonus"". Poland has just introduced a policy of zero personal income tax for families with two or more children. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has introduced tax exemptions for mothers. But for all the the statistics and policymaking this is, ultimately, a very personal decision. Natalie couldn't be prouder of her daughter, who has recently been made ""values ambassador"" in her class, encouraging other children to show empathy and respect. ""She has been chosen, not because she's an only child, because they don't know whether she's got siblings or not. She's been chosen based on her personality,"" says Natalie. ""I don't think I was ever worried about not giving her [a sibling], because you can never have a child for somebody else. ""You've got to have a child for yourself, haven't you?"""
China US,US calls for international action to cut weapons supply to Sudan paramilitaries,2025-11-14T08:20:20.531Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1nwy7q8o,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are accused of mass killings in el-Fasher. At the end of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada, Rubio said the RSF had committed systematic atrocities, including murder, rape and sexual violence against civilians. Sudan's army accuses the United Arab Emirates of propping up the RSF with weapons and mercenaries sent via African nations. The UAE and the RSF have repeatedly denied these allegations. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into all-out civil war. Rubio's comments are some of the most outspoken so far by the Trump administration about the war in Sudan and the actions of the RSF, but it is not clear how much impact they will have. A previous US-backed proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan has already been violated by the RSF, even though they agreed to it last week. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF after an 18-month siege, meaning they now control all of the cities in the vast western Darfur region. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee the city, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Non-Arab groups in the wider Darfur region are being systematically targeted by the RSF in what amounts to genocide, according to the US and humanitarian groups. At the talks near Niagara Falls on Wednesday, America's top diplomat said women and children had been targeted in acts of the most horrific kind by the RSF in el-Fasher. Rubio told reporters: ""They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind.  And it needs to end immediately. ""And we're going to do everything we can to bring it to an end, and we've encouraged partner nations to join us in this fight."" However, Rubio stopped short of publicly criticising Abu Dhabi, in spite of evidence that the Gulf state is the RSF's main arms supplier, presented in investigations by the international media that the UN has found credible. The Trump administration is working for an end to the war together with the UAE, as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who are allies of Sudan's military-led government, collectively known as the ""Quad"". ""I don't want to get into calling anybody out at a press conference today, because what we want is a good outcome here,"" Rubio said on Wednesday, but added pointedly: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" In September, the Quad jointly proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. In a statement on Thursday, the UAE expressed ""alarm at the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in El Fasher"". It went on to accuse the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusations the army has previously denied. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. The secretary of state rejected the paramilitary group's attempt to blame the killings on rogue elements, saying this was false and the attacks were systematic. Asked by the BBC about his assessment of the likely scale of atrocities, he said the US feared that thousands of people who had been expected to flee el-Fasher were either dead or too malnourished to move. He said the RSF, lacking its own arms manufacturing facilities, relied on outside support, and called for countries supplying weapons to stop. In response the RSF issued a lengthy statement denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"". The paramilitary group repeated denials that it does not receive support from external parties and said it did not accept attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. ""The party that has rejected all ceasefire initiatives and refused to engage in them is the army affiliated with the terrorist Islamic Movement,"" it said, ""while our forces responded in good faith officially announcing their approval. Yet to this day we have not received any reply from the US side. So, where is the other party and where is its response?"" The joint G7 statement also condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". To date, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes. The flow of weapons into the country during this two-year-long civil war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales.

China US,Mysterious drones have been spotted at night at airports across Europe. How worried should we be?,2025-11-17T00:17:43.171Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkl3d6pegpo,"It's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens. This is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine. These are attack drones that explode on impact. Drones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield. Across western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of ""hybrid warfare"" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine. Recent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries. Now, there is talk that a ""drone wall"" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic? On 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports. Nato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions. This was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began. Which is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing. ""This momentum is really driven by these recent incursions,"" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank. Drones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space. On the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices. But these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall. Previously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September. So, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond? After all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: ""[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money."" Ukraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians. Then there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet. But there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war. That is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared. Sometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports. This includes a suspected drone incursion above Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. Unlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these ""civilian drones"" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships. Suspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility. Belgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions). There is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base? The UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones. Still, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants. The plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia. The wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea. It's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027. Not surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia. Katja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue. But she adds:  ""This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders."" Nonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic. Robert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some ""sort of impervious wall"", is, in his words, out of the question. Yet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try. ""For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,"" he says. ""The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable"", agrees Ms Bego. ""It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them."" Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones. ""You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets. ""You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill."" Hard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means. Russia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders. As for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters. ""You can have lasers which could be useful as well,"" he adds, ""but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be."" André Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once. As tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called ""hybrid"" or ""grey zone"" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them. These include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables. And yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority. The first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised. Meanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge. Mr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. ""You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres. ""And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap."" The question of finance is a complex one. ""It is a really difficult defence question,"" says Mr Tollast. ""Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well. ""So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people."" It will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets. Initially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it. ""Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion... ""The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets"". As for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, ""they can definitely achieve more protection by then"". While all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them. This all makes it something of a new arms race. ""The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,"" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology. ""It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust. ""The aggressor"", he concludes, ""will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through"". So are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow. ""It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,"" argues Ms Bego. ""And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this."" But any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory. Ever since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war. Building a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another."
China US,Elon Musk's $1tn pay deal approved by Tesla shareholders,2025-11-07T10:03:09.647Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyk6kvyxvzo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders. The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares. The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him. Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name. ""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" he said. ""Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,"" he added. The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include: He won't receive a salary under the agreed deal. But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough. Musk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an ""autonomous humanoid robot"" performing ""unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks."" Using the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future. He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would - and in future, in homes. ""Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,"" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X. ""His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet."" Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was ""almost comfortable"" allowing drivers to ""text and drive essentially."" US regulators are after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries. Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months. Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring. Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks ""another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business."" Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. It is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added. Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over ""the polarisation of [Musk's] persona"" which has ""demolished the value of the brand"". ""Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,"" he said. Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him ""Tesla's biggest asset"" in a note published after the vote. ""We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,"" Mr Ives added. Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he ""hit those milestones ahead of schedule"" in 2018. She said his political interests had created some ""polarisation"", but his pay package did not ""put any constraints on his activities"" outside of the company. Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did. But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk. Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision. The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting. In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts. A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk. Kathryn Hannon, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the new pay deal would give Musk ""increasing voting power over the company"", which he had long been requesting for a number of years. ""Elon Musk, whether you like him or not, he is a visionary in this space and I guess putting the correct governance and incentivisation structures around him to deliver this does align him, hopefully, with shareholders on that success journey."""
China US,Tutoring a baby to make him an 'English gentleman' - Is it worth the money?,2025-11-10T08:38:50.561Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kljww1zdo,"When reading this advert, you would be forgiven for skimming over the words ""first steps"", as a turn of phrase. But, it could be the most significant part of this unique job advert, as it seeks to find a tutor for a one-year-old. Hundreds of applications have now been submitted since the anonymous family published their request for the £180k-a-year tutor, who has to be ""someone very special"". Over the last few weeks, the advert has gained attention across the media, with many questioning why? Adam Caller, CEO and founder of Tutors International, which is assisting the family in their search, said despite initial scepticism, he found the idea ""far sighted"", and ""progressive"". When he met the family, he said they appreciated the unusual nature of their request, and how young their son is. However, they explained that they ""didn't want to wait any longer"" to get a tutor, as they had waited until their older child was five, and by that stage ""cultural bias had already set in"". But what does the family mean by ""cultural bias""? It's ""everything"", Adam replied. ""The way you eat, the way you speak."" He said the older sibling had picked ""really subtle, non-verbal cues"" from the family, and had adopted their cultural ways. The family told Adam they did not want history to repeat itself with their new baby. The plan: , who must speak with received pronunciation, to influence the baby right from the beginning. ""A lot of the learning at the beginning here is kind of osmotic,"" said Adam. It's via this osmosis that the family are hoping the child will pick up the British traits they wish to instil. Adam said the tutor had to be somebody who went to ""the right kinds of schools - the same kinds of schools as the family aspire to send their son to"". ""The tutor just has to be the right kind of person, they'll be doing things they don't even know they're doing, just naturally,"" he said. The family told Adam the successful candidate should ideally also have knowledge of or interest in horse-riding, skiing, the arts and music so as to influence the child in a broad spectrum of interests. More than that though, he said the family wanted the tutor to enrol the child on a range of classes so the child would be ""pony-riding and picking up an instrument by the time they are around three years old"". In the family's minds, helping their son become a ""British gentleman"" will lead to success and open doors. ""For all the rights and wrongs of that, because it's definitely a class statement,"" he adds. But, despite all this tutelage in ""Britishness"", could the child pick up so-called cultural bias from the international family he lives with anyway? ""Yes"", said Adam. ""The family know this may not work, but they've just taken the view of, 'let's give it a go and let's go as early as we can', because the cost of it is not relevant,"" he said. There are some in the tutoring industry who share those concerns. Peter Cui, CEO and founder of Blue Education, which also offers private tutors, wrote that ""the process of becoming bicultural, or indeed, becoming oneself, is something that must be lived into, not engineered"". Peter wrote that he had moved from China to the UK at the age of seven, and had been raised knowing and living both cultures. He went on to study at Cambridge University. ""The idea that one individual can serve as a living vessel of Britishness, someone who can somehow transplant the qualities of a British gentleman on to a one-year-old child, strikes me as idealistic and unrealistic,"" he wrote. ""In my experience, having a quintessentially British tutor from infancy will not automatically produce the outcome they desire. ""I never had such a figure, and yet I have been fortunate enough to live many of the experiences they aspire for their son."" He added: ""The truth is, cultural identity cannot be imposed from the outside; it must be chosen, and it must come from within."" Of course, Britishness is something Adam hopes can be taught - and sold. ""I think the fact that the world holds us in this regard is something that we should be cherishing and taking advantage of at the same time,"" he said. ""I don't think that, as British people, we should be embarrassed by this,"" Adam said. ""I think we should be proud of it."" The market for buying Britishness isn't just helping Adam's tutoring business, it's given rise to businesses such as Laura Windsor's Etiquette Academy. Laura, like other ""etiquette experts"", can teach people - for a fee - how to take afternoon tea, dress and hold a conversation, ""like a British person"". ""Society has become so diluted and unrestrained, people now want to go back to the way it was,"" she said. The demand for etiquette training is mainly from international clients who wish to be able to interact at business meetings and functions, she said. But she also teaches groups of children too. Why? ""Because being a polite gentleman or gentlewoman is all about first impressions,"" she said. ""Being polite means you respect other people, you make them feel comfortable and important. When you make people feel important, you're liked, and that opens doors to incredible opportunities."" She says she teaches people how it's ""all in the details"": ""It's about opening doors, and saying 'please' and 'thank you', and thinking about the other person."" Laura's students are never usually as young as one, but starting that young is something the etiquette expert says can have benefits. ""Starting at one, they will grow up being a gentleman, and therefore it's not a question of 'tweaking', it's who they are. ""Whereas nowadays, people need to be tweaked a little bit, to be a little bit more aware of what they do,"" she said. Raising his children to be classically British - with all the etiquette trimmings - is not the priority for Daniel (not his real name). ""Far from leaning into English, British values, we wanted the total opposite. We are trying to go away from the UK system and the straitjacket of that,"" he said. Daniel is currently employing one of Adam's super-tutors to work with his three children around their school hours. Next year the tutor will accompany the whole family as they move abroad for work. For Daniel and his wife, it's about teaching emotional intelligence, and preparing their children for a world influenced by artificial intelligence. Neither believes this is possible without an external tutor. The current British school system ""isn't fit for purpose"", he said, adding that one private school in London, has now dropped most of the GCSE examination system and instead uses its own in-house system which involves more group work activities and project-based learning. ""If GCSEs aren't going to be recognised everywhere - and are not the gold standard - maybe we would be better leaning into a tutor where we get so much more out of it,"" Daniel said. ""Right here, right now, in the UK school system, if I look at the quality of teacher my kids would get at a private school versus these tutors, it's an absolute joke - there is a real discrepancy,"" he said. He added that he recognised hiring a high-end tutor was for ""those in a lucky financial situation"", but explained that since private school fees , he felt the cost of the private tutor had become comparable for three children. ""My kids could have one-20th of a very average person's attention in school, or they could have one-third of an absolutely exceptional person - it's an absolute no-brainer."""
China US,The private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UK's Covid response,2025-11-20T00:12:50.970Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78zy20ydlmo,"It was the most momentous event in UK history since World War Two. As a new virus took hold, millions of us were told to stay at home and billions of pounds were spent propping up the country's economy. The Covid inquiry will publish its second set of findings on Thursday, looking in detail at the huge political choices made at the time - including how lockdowns were introduced, the closure of businesses and schools, and bringing in previously unthinkable social restrictions. ""Did the government serve the people well, or did it fail them?"" asked the lead counsel at the start of this part of the inquiry in 2023. Since then more than 7,000 documents have been made public from the time, including WhatsApp chats and emails, private diaries and confidential files. Here, BBC News has picked out some of the urgent messages and scribbled notes that shine a light on how critical decisions were taken in 2020. On 2 January 2020 , a service used by health workers to warn of emerging diseases. ""World Health Organization in touch with Beijing after mystery viral pneumonia outbreak,"" it says. ""Twenty-seven people - most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - treated in hospital."" The next day England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, sends the bulletin on to Peter Horby, a professor at Oxford University and chair of Nervtag, a group that advises the government on new viral threats. By the end of January, it's clear the health authorities in Wuhan have a major problem on their hands. The deputy ambassador to China, Christina Scott, comparing the situation to the outbreak of another virus - SARS - in 2003. ""Hubei province on lockdown; multiple cities have transport restrictions. Memory of SARS cover-up ensures residual distrust of government response,"" it says. ""They will do everything they can to quickly control this outbreak. But the challenge of doing so is substantial."" The virus spreads to Thailand and South Korea and then to Iran and northern Italy. At lunchtime on Saturday 7 March the UK's then prime minister, Boris Johnson, is ahead of the England vs Wales game at Twickenham. Days later, the Cheltenham horse racing festival goes ahead and Atletico Madrid fans are allowed to fly from Spain to Liverpool to watch their team play in the Champions League. The government's strategy, backed by its scientific advisers, is to try to contain early outbreaks by isolating those with the virus and tracing any contacts. The plan is then to move to a ""delay phase"" as full community transmission is established – using policies like home isolation advice for those with symptoms to ""flatten the curve"" of the pandemic so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed. But the virus is spreading much faster than expected and it‘s quickly becoming clear to some scientists that far stronger action will be needed. On Friday 13 March, two senior No 10 officials are sitting in a key meeting of scientific advisers in Whitehall. ""WE ARE NOT READY,"" . The other leans over and crosses out ""NOT READY"", replacing it with an expletive. That weekend, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is locked in a series of meetings with the PM and a handful of select staff as a new strategy takes shape. Grainy smartphone images show whiteboards in No 10 and . One graph suggests that, if the virus was allowed to run its course without any restrictions in place, then more than 100,000 people would die ""in [hospital] corridors"" in the coming wave. On Sunday 15 March, Cummings : ""FYI – [Patrick] Vallance [the chief scientific adviser] is on board with what will NEVER be discussed as Plan B."" ""[In a] nutshell: we move through the gears to [do] whatever we need to stop NHS collapse and buy time to increase capacity."" Over the following week, Covid rules across the UK are tightened. People are advised, but not legally required, to avoid all non-essential contact and work from home where possible. Then schools are closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas. But still there are concerns that even those measures are not strong enough. On Sunday 22 March, London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, . The next evening, in a televised address watched by 27 million people, the prime minister tells the public they must stay at home as he announces the first national lockdown. It will now be up to the inquiry to decide if making that call earlier could have saved lives and ultimately reduced the total time that people had to stay locked indoors. Over the next month some hospitals do come under severe pressure with intensive care units spilling into corridors and side rooms. Pre-planned or elective care is put on hold but at no point does the NHS have to turn away emergency patients. Covid infections, hospitalisations and deaths start to fall. But the cost of lockdown restrictions is huge: education is disrupted, loneliness and mental health problems get worse, and jobs and businesses are impacted. On 22 May, Johnson asking for a plan to ""start operation BOUNCEBACK"". That month some restrictions begin to be lifted – soon groups of six are able to meet outdoors and schools start a phased re-opening. In the summer, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak tries to boost the economy with his Eat Out to Help Out scheme - 50% off food and drinks for three days a week in August. The idea is well received by the hospitality industry but there are concerns about the health impact. On WhatsApp (with spelling mistakes), Hancock warns Simon Case, then the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, that it's - that’s those local authorities with the highest infection rates. In his evidence to the inquiry, saying a second wave ""happened in every other country in Europe"". But that tension – between controlling Covid and protecting the economy – becomes even more intense through the autumn. Many scientists advising the government want to see tighter rules. They campaign for a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown to try to drive down infections. At times the documents suggest the prime minister supports tougher restrictions, at others he appears determined to avoid another strict national lockdown at all costs. On WhatsApp – using an emoji of a broken trolley as he appears to swerve from one policy position to another. ""This government doesn't have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not to,"" writes Case, who is now the new cabinet secretary, to Cummings and Lee Cain, No 10 director of communications, on 14 October. ""We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this."" In his testimony to the inquiry, Case later says he regrets expressing his ""at-the-moment frustrations"" with Johnson, whom he ""barely knew"" at the time. In his evidence, Johnson defends his own leadership style, saying his views changed with the scientific evidence, and he often adopted certain positions because he wanted to hear the counter arguments. As the nights draw in that autumn, it becomes clear that existing restrictions in England - including a 10pm curfew and the so-called tiered system of local controls - are not going to be enough to control the virus. By the end of October, the prime minister's frustration is obvious in the long note he marked OFFICIAL/SENSITIVE. In tightly spaced handwriting, Johnson pens 22 detailed points over two A4 pages of the document. He approves of strengthening some local restrictions but bemoans the ""terrible cost"" and wonders ""for HOW LONG?"" ""Is NHS T&T [test and trace] actually achieving ANYTHING?"" he asks at one point. A week later, on 5 November 2020, England does enter its second national lockdown, this time lasting four weeks, although most schools remain open. By this point many decisions are being taken independently by the four nations of the UK. Both Wales and Northern Ireland put in place versions of a circuit breaker lockdown, while in Scotland stricter rules are imposed in the central belt. The plan is still to allow families and friends to meet up at Christmas. But by mid-December a new, more infectious variant of the virus is spreading and millions living in the south-east of England are told at short notice that Christmas mixing will be cancelled. In January 2021, a third and final full national lockdown follows across the UK, as the winter wave peaks and the NHS starts rolling out millions of doses of the first Covid vaccines. Five years on from those dramatic 12 months, the inquiry's findings are long-awaited, particularly by the 235,000 families who lost loved ones in the pandemic. The messages and documents highlighted here are just a snapshot - the report due later will run to around 800 pages. It will examine some of the key questions in much more detail: the timing of lockdowns, the impact of restrictions on the most vulnerable, and public confidence in the rules amid reports of partying in Downing Street and other alleged rule breaches. Groups representing thousands of bereaved families want individuals working in government at the time to be held to account for any pandemic failings. But - above all - they want the state to learn lessons from any mistakes and be better prepared if and when the next unknown virus arrives on our shores.

China US,Swap shops reducing waste grow in popularity ,2025-11-08T07:25:02.177Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6zg2qe40o,"A community group dedicated to reducing waste said the popularity of its ""swap shop"" events is increasing. Sustainable Devizes first held a Devizes Swap Shop in 2022 from a small stand in the town's market place, with a couple of tables of books and toys. The event, which is now held at least three times a year and is attended by hundreds of people, is taking place later at St James' Church. People are encouraged to donate unwanted toys, games, crafts, books, houseplants and school uniforms, and can take anything away for free in exchange. Helen Langford now volunteers at the swap shops after first using the service herself. ""One time, I found it quite moving because I remember a particular lady who had a few children with her and she was basically saying, 'I couldn't have got through Christmas without this', and I knew it was making a really big difference,"" she said. ""For me personally, I was driven by trying to be more eco-friendly and trying to spend less, waste less and see stuff used for its whole life, rather than just used for a  season and out the door."" The founder, Sam Drury Shore, said: ""The reason I love the swaps is the co-benefits they bring. ""Our initial motivation was very much about reducing waste, and trying to gently change people's mindsets around consumption. ""But with the cost of living crisis, we can really see that the swaps are a huge help to families - hopefully without it seeming patronising or stigmatising as our framing is 'you are helping by reducing waste', rather than 'you are being helped by being given free stuff'."" The Devizes Swap Shop is taking place at St James' Church from 10:00 GMT."
China US,Where is The Celebrity Traitors castle and can I ride the train?,2025-11-07T08:54:27.414Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4njdj4kxw2o,"The winner of The Celebrity Traitors was unveiled in a dramatic finale on Thursday night. The hit BBC series' inaugural celebrity edition featured a line-up of contestants including comedian Stephen Fry, singer Paloma Faith and Olympian Tom Daley. Host Claudia Winkleman pitted a handful of secret traitors against faithfuls at Ardross Castle, a grand Highland property that is one of the reality TV show's biggest stars - including a challenge on the Strathspey Railway. The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century pile about 30 miles north of Inverness. It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland near the Easter Ross town of Alness. The property was built more than 170 years ago in a Scottish baronial style, a type of elaborate architecture featuring complex rooflines with turrets and fortress-like battlements. More than 200 years ago - long before the castle was built - the land at Ardross was owned by George Granville Leveson-Gower, the 1st Duke of Sutherland. He had a hunting lodge on the site where the castle stands today. The duke was a controversial figure in the Highland Clearances. In large parts of Sutherland, he had people cleared off land where they had lived for generations to make way for sheep farming and agricultural ""improvements"". Some families were moved to coastal villages, while others became emigrants and made difficult journeys to Canada to start new lives there. There is a statue of the duke on a hilltop north of Ardross. Known locally as The Mannie, and overlooking Golspie, it has been the target of vandalism and even attempts . Years later the estate at Ardross was bought by Sir Alexander Matheson. Matheson made his fortune . He was an MP and an instrumental figure in the building of railways in the Highlands. And he had the castle, so familiar to Traitors fans today, constructed. Ross and Cromarty Heritage Society says that from 1847, about 400 workers were involved in the property's construction. They built 30 rooms and laid out the castle's extensive grounds. According to Ardross Castle's website, Sir Alexander also improved estate workers' housing. After Sir Alexander's death, the country house and its estate was sold to businessman and philanthropist Charles William Dyson Perrins. His grandfather William Perrins, in partnership with John Wheeley Lea, created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce. The Perrins family was also involved in the production of Royal Worcester porcelain. Charles William Dyson Perrins joined the family business after four years serving in the Highland Light Infantry. He and his family were annual visitors to Ardross Castle. The Perrins' ownership came to an end in the 1930s and various parts of the estate was sold off. In 1983, the castle was bought by the McTaggart family and they still own it today. While not run as a hotel, the property is available as a wedding venue - its popularity undoubtedly boosted by its appearance in The Traitors. In 2023, Loukas Tsarmaklis, a director of Ardross Castle Enterprises, told they ""try to keep a low profile... but there is no chance now."" ""This has put us on the map and helped local B&Bs, tradesmen, taxi drivers, cleaners. It was a big operation for this part of the world,"" he added. The castle's owners politely declined to comment on the impact the show has had to BBC Scotland News, but internet searches for the castle have been on the rise. Ross and Cromarty Heritage Society said views of its page about Ardross increased significantly because of the US show. Strathspey Railway is a volunteer-run company that operates a 10-mile (16km) route between Aviemore and Broomhill, via Boat of Garten. The heritage railway's line is part of the former Inverness and Perth Junction Railway, later called the Highland, which linked Aviemore with Forres. It is one of only a handful of former lines to be preserved following rail closures in the 1960s. The company has a fleet of steam and diesel locomotives which are run and maintained by a mix of volunteers and a small number of paid staff. It has frequently been involved in restoration projects, . The Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 engine - No. 46464 - was one of five built in Crewe, Cheshire, in 1950. It spent most of its working life based at Dundee Tay Bridge Steam Shed 62B, operating on services in Angus and Fife. Last week, Strathspey Railway said it had received a £1m donation from a mystery American donor . The railway runs trips throughout the year and is now operating to a winter timetable, which includes a festive Elf Express. Joining Claudia Winkleman in the castle were . They included comedian Alan Carr, singer and broadcaster Charlotte Church and former England rugby player Joe Marler. Also, broadcaster Kate Garraway, presenter Jonathan Ross and content creator Niko Omilana. Among those from the world of acting were Mark Bonnar, Tamela Empson and Celia Imrie."
China US,William puts flood-hit Welsh town in COP spotlight,2025-11-07T13:04:28.241Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4j8er4xjmo,"The Prince of Wales has put the plight of a flood-ravaged town in south Wales at the heart of his message to world leaders gathered in Brazil for the COP30 summit. Prince William said he was ""deeply moved"" by the resilience of the people in Pontypridd, whom he in February after devastating . ""One resident told me how the river that once brought life to the town had become a source of fear,"" he said, in a high-profile speech given in the city of Belem, in the heart of the Amazon. The prince called for ""courage, co-operation and unwavering commitment"" to tackle the climate crisis, warning of a ""critical tipping point"" ahead. ""We must ask ourselves, what legacy do we wish to leave?"" said Prince William, who was joined by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and  Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the annual climate summit. The prince warned humanity was edging towards the ""Earth's critical tipping points"", citing ""the melting of polar ice, the loss of the Amazon, the disruption of ocean currents"". ""These are not distant threats,"" he said. ""They are fast-approaching and will affect every one of us, no matter where we live."" In Pontypridd, earlier this year, the prince said he and the princess met ""families who had lost their homes, their possessions, and their sense of security"". ""Their resilience was deeply moving. ""It was also a powerful reminder that climate change is not a distant threat,"" he said. ""It is affecting lives across the UK, and across the world - from small towns to major cities, from coastal communities to inland regions. ""No corner of the globe will be unaffected."" Sir Keir spoke directly after Prince William, challenging climate sceptics with a promise to double-down on net zero, on the issue of climate change. The Prime Minister staunchly defended the UK government's clean energy agenda, but conceded that cross-party unity on science ""that is unequivocal"" has splintered, both in Britain and globally. Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit. After Thursday's speech, the prince posed for a picture with Brazil's president, Lula, and Sir Keir, laughing as they brought their hands together in a triple handshake, and walking off the stage in unison. The speech at COP30 was Prince William's highest-profile public address to date, speaking on behalf of the UK government and his father, King Charles, with whom he shared the contents of his address before his departure for Brazil. ""I grew up with my father – the King – talking about the power of nature and the importance of harmony in the natural world,"" he said. ""A subject he has championed for over five decades. ""It is a privilege to also represent him here today, as well as everyone else who has championed this cause, for so many years."" The prince also praised as ""visionary"" a Brazilian-led fund for rainforests – seen as key to the UN Cop30 climate summit, but which the British Government has said it will not currently invest in, ahead of the Budget later this month. Prince William's five-day trip to Brazil, his first to the country, included , on Wednesday ""When we unite behind shared purpose, we can scale and accelerate solutions that transcend borders,"" he told delegates at COP30. ""Solutions that give us hope, and fill us with optimism, for the future."" He went on to talk about one of the Earthshot Prize finalists, as he called for unity in the fight for climate change. ""Brazil's proposal for the Tropical Forests Forever fund is a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability. That is why it was an Earthshot Prize finalist this year. ""The initiative recognises that climate and nature must be addressed together – not in silos, but in synergy. ""The science is clear – we must go further if we are to secure a liveable future for all. And we must go together. ""The time for partnership, protection, and progress is now. ""We know what is at stake. We know what must be done. And we know that no country, no community, no individual can do it alone."""
China US,A simple guide to what is happening in Sudan,2025-11-13T14:12:12.647Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjel2nn22z9o,"Sudan plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious struggle for power broke out between its army and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It has led to a famine and claims of a genocide in the western Darfur region - with fears for the residents of city of el-Fasher after it was recently captured by the RSF. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes in what the United Nations has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Here is what you need to know. It is the latest episode in bouts of tension that followed the 2019 ousting of long-serving President Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in a coup in 1989. There were huge street protests calling for an end to his near-three decade rule and the army mounted a coup to get rid of him. But civilians continued to campaign for the introduction of democracy. A joint military-civilian government was then established but that was overthrown in another coup in October 2021. The coup was staged by the two men at the centre of the current conflict: But then Gen Burhan and Gen Dagalo disagreed on the direction the country was going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule. The main sticking points were plans to incorporate the 100,000-strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the new force. The suspicions were that both generals wanted to hang on to their positions of power, unwilling to lose wealth and influence. Shooting between the two sides began on 15 April 2023 following days of tension as members of the RSF were redeployed around the country in a move that the army saw as a threat. It is disputed who fired the first shot but the fighting swiftly escalated, with the RSF seizing much of Khartoum until the army regained control of it almost two years later in March 2025. The RSF was formed in 2013 and , where they were accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the region's black African, non-Arab population. Since then, Gen Dagalo has built a powerful force that has intervened in conflicts in Yemen and Libya. He also controls some of Sudan's gold mines, and allegedly smuggles the metal to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The army accuses the UAE of backing the RSF, and carrying out drone strikes in Sudan. The oil-rich Gulf state denies the allegation. The army also accuses eastern Libyan strongman Gen Khalifa Haftar of supporting the RSF by helping it to smuggle weapons into Sudan, and sending fighters to bolster the RSF. In early June 2025, the RSF achieved a major victory when it took control of territory along Sudan's border with Libya and Egypt. This was followed by the capture of el-Fasher in late October, meaning it controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan. With the RSF's recent formation of a rival government, it is likely Sudan will split for a second time - South Sudan seceded in 2011, taking with it most of the country's oil fields. The military controls most of the north and the east. Its main backer is said to be Egypt, whose fortunes are intertwined with those of Sudan because they share a border and the waters of the River Nile. Gen Burhan has turned Port Sudan - which is on the Red Sea - into his headquarters, and that of his UN-recognised government. However, the city is not safe - the RSF launched a there in March. This was retaliation after the RSF suffered one of its biggest setbacks, when it lost control of Khartoum - including the Republican Palace - to the army in March. ""Khartoum is free, it's done,"" Gen Burhan declared, as he triumphantly returned to the city, though not permanently. by the time the RSF left, with government ministries, banks and towering office blocks stand blackened and burned. Hospitals and clinics were destroyed, hit by air strikes and artillery fire, sometimes with patients still inside. The international airport - which was a graveyard of smashed planes - re-opened in mid-October to domestic flights, though its official opening was delayed by a day because a RSF drone hit an area nearby. The army has also managed to win back near total control of the crucial state of Gezira. , forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee its main city of Wad Madani, which had become a refuge for those who had escaped conflict in other parts of the country. But el-Fasher, which was the last major urban centre in Darfur held by the army and its allies, . Over 18 months, the RSF laid siege to the city, causing hundreds of casualties, overwhelming hospitals and blocking food supplies. It recently stepped up it efforts by building an earthen wall around the city to trap residents and stop food from reaching people - and destroyed the nearby Zamzam displacement camp which had already been hit by famine. Many Darfuris believe the RSF and allied militias have waged a war aimed at transforming the ethnically mixed region into an Arab-dominated area. In March 2024, the UN children's agency, Unicef, gave harrowing accounts of armed men . Some children have tried to end their own lives as a result. In the same month, in Darfur against the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities. Thousands had been killed in el-Geneina city in a campaign of ethnic cleansing with the ""apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region"", it said. HRW added that the widespread killings raised the possibility that the RSF and their allies had ""the intent to destroy in whole or in part""  the Massalit people. As this could constitute a genocide, it appealed to international bodies and governments to carry out an investigation. fell short of concluding that a genocide was taking place. Instead, it found that that both the RSF and army had committed war crimes. However, the US determined in January this year that the RSF and allied militias have committed a genocide. ""The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys - even infants - on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,"" then-Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said. ""Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies. Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,"" he added. This led to the US imposing sanctions on Gen Dagalo, followed by . Sudan's government filed a case against the UAE in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of being complicit in the genocide by funding and arming the RSF. However, the ICJ refused to hear the case, saying that it had no jurisdiction over it. The UAE welcomed its ruling, with an official saying that the Gulf state . However, UN experts say allegations that the UAE is supporting the RSF are credible. The RSF also denies committing genocide, saying it was not involved in what it describes as a ""tribal conflict"" in Darfur. But the UN investigators said they had received testimony that RSF fighters taunted non-Arab women during sex attacks with racist slurs and saying they will force them to have ""Arab babies"". With reports of there are concerns about the fate of an estimated 250,000 people in the city, many from non-Arab communities. There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but they have failed. In early November, the RSF announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt. However, , accusing the RSF of not respecting ceasefires. UN health chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also lamented that there is less global interest in the conflict in Sudan, and other recent conflicts in Africa, compared to crises elsewhere in the world. ""I think race is in the play here,"" . The International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank has called diplomatic efforts to end the war ""lacklustre"", while Amnesty International has labelled the world's response ""woefully inadequate"". Humanitarian work has also been badly affected by the decision of the Trump administration to cut aid. The WFP says more than 24 million people in the country are facing acute food insecurity. Aid volunteers told the BBC that more than 1,100 - or almost 80% - of the , fuelling the perception that Sudan's conflict is the ""forgotten war"" of the world. There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of Sudan despite calls from human rights groups. The flow of weapons into the country has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of being the main provider of arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. As for the Sudanese Armed Forces, . All parties deny these allegations. In October 2025, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" At a later summit of G7 foreign ministers, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to the RSF. Sudan is in north-east Africa and is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million sq km (734,000 sq miles). It borders seven countries and the Red Sea. The River Nile also flows through it, making it a strategically important for foreign powers. The population of Sudan is predominantly Muslim and the country's official languages are Arabic and English. Even before the war started, Sudan was one of the poorest countries in the world - despite the fact that it is a gold-producing nation. Its 46 million people were living on an average annual income of $750 (£600) a head in 2022. The conflict has made things much worse. Last year, Sudan's finance minister said state revenues had shrunk by 80%."
China US,Asylum seekers will be banned from taking taxis for medical appointments,2025-11-29T13:27:54.541Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjn2y4eed5o,"Asylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced. It comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxis or minicabs, with one asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, . In response, the government into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September. Now the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around £15.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers. Earlier this year, found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used. On Friday, one driver told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said. Another taxi driver, who gave the name Steve, claimed firms would purposely increase the mileage on trips by dispatching drivers to another distant town to carry out short journeys. He told File on Four that on one occasion he was sent from Gatwick Airport to Reading - a round trip of about 110 miles (175km) and costing more than £100 - to take an asylum seeker from their hotel to a dentist appointment which was 1.5 miles away. Steve said that while working for a subcontractor he was sent from Gatwick to Southampton ""more than once"", and that he drove an average of 275 miles a day - half of which was without a passenger in his car. He claimed that some journeys were completely wasted. ""I'd be sitting there and [would be told] 'oh look don't worry, [the asylum seekers] don't wanna go' and they basically refused to move. It just logistically wasn't thought out very well and I think it was left open to abuse,"" he said. But Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this was now going to change. She said: ""I am ending the unrestricted use of taxis by asylum seekers for hospital appointments, authorising them only in the most exceptional circumstances. ""I will continue to root out waste as we close every single asylum hotel."" She said the government had inherited expensive Conservative contracts. Instead of taxis, ministers want asylum seekers to use alternatives like public transport. There will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy-related needs. These will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules. There are other circumstances in which taxis can be used - such as moving between accommodation - but ministers are reviewing the wider use of taxis for asylum seekers and want to extend the principle that they are only used in exceptional circumstances with support evidence. Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said the current use of taxis was ""symptomatic of an asylum system that allows private contractors to make vast profits at the expense of the taxpayer"". He added that: ""It is more a consequence of government incompetence and poor contract management than people in the asylum system exploiting it."" Mr Solomon called for an end to ""profiteering"" contracts and for more asylum seekers to be allowed to work ""so they can support themselves"". Ministers have pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the next election. They want to increase the use of alternative accommodation, such as large military sites. But figures earlier this week showed 36,273 people were still living in asylum hotels in the UK - an increase compared to June. There has also been criticism of the growing cost of running asylum accommodation, which has gone up significantly since the contracts were signed. When the home secretary was asked if the government was prepared to exercise break clauses in contracts with providers in a BBC interview earlier this year, Mahmood said she would explore all options. But doing so would mean alternative accommodation needs to be found. The government has also announced significant changes to overhaul the asylum system, with refugee status becoming temporary and the ending of guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers. The since it came to power but the chair of the home affairs select committee said that was only a start. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: ""The issue is that Labour can't get a grip on the illegal immigration crisis. ""As Labour hammer working people with £26 billion in tax rises, they have allowed costs for illegal arrivals to spiral because Labour don't have the backbone to take the tough decisions needed. ""Namely, deporting all illegal arrivals and leaving the ECHR. Until that happens, the bills will keep mounting."""
China US,How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor,2025-11-10T00:17:37.214Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yl88wd3lo,"You probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been the in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa, The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead. This American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. ""The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,"" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. ""This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market."" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. ""We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity"". Sepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. ""To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,"" she says. ""So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants."" Ms Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. ""There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,"" she says. ""You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc."" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative. One US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa is in South Africa's Gauteng province. ""It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,"" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa. However, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick. He argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough. ""Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,"" says Prof Branstetter. Going forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haihambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."
China US,China launches new aircraft carrier in naval race with the US,2025-11-07T08:00:25.247Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e0yx39g5o,"China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds. Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships. China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up. The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong. State media hailed the Fujian as a ""major milestone"" in the development of China's navy. The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian. The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea. State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: ""Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!"""
China US,Devastating toxic spill seen as test of whether African countries will stand up to China,2025-12-02T06:02:35.007Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nly288j4o,"Even before the dam collapsed, Lamec did not feel safe working at the copper mine. ""If our work protective gear gets damaged, it is not always replaced,"" he tells us. ""We have to take a risk and use it again."" He is talking to the BBC in a car on a quiet backroad near a village in northern Zambia, too nervous to speak to us in public or to use his real name, for fear that speaking to the press might cost him his livelihood. When he turned up for his shift one day in February, he tells us, he found that one of the dams at the Chinese-owned mine had been closed. The tailings dam - used to store toxic by-products from the copper mining process, including heavy metals like arsenic, mercury and lead - had collapsed into a tributary connected to the Kafue, Zambia's longest river and a major drinking water source. At least 50,000 tonnes of acidic debris spilled out into the surrounding waterways and farmland, according to the government. Some environmentalists, however, claim as much as 1.5 million tonnes was spilled, with one expert saying a full clean-up could take longer than a decade. The spill has killed the fish around the towns of Chambishi and Kitwe, made the water undrinkable and destroyed crops, farmers have told the BBC. There are fears that, now the rainy season has started, heavy metals still sitting in the mud will further infiltrate the land and waterways, causing a second wave of pollution. Toxic metals that can cause kidney damage and cancers, as well as gastric and intestinal issues, could be carried downstream to the capital, Lusaka, says Dr Mweene Himwiinga, a senior lecturer at Zambia's Copperbelt University. The Chinese embassy in Lusaka disputes the scale of the damage and told the BBC it welcomed the establishment of an independent investigation into the incident. The Zambian government, it said, had reported that the pollution was contained to a confined area, water acidity levels had returned to normal limits and that ongoing checks showed no lasting public-health risks. Lamec, like his country Zambia, finds himself in a difficult position. The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse. More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment. In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households. They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement. The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories. ""All eyes are on this case,"" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. ""Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved."" People found it hard to believe at first ""because something of this scale had not happened before,"" he adds. The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining. Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China. But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba. ""There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,"" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. ""We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue."" Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese. Between 2000 and 2023, 49 African countries are believed to have signed $182.3bn (£139.4bn) worth of loans with Chinese lenders. In Copperbelt Province, Lamec tells us he was really broken by the spill affecting his family. ""We were told that the waterways now had acid in them, and that we were not supposed to use the water."" For two weeks after the spill, Lamec says he and his family weren't allowed to use the local water until it had been sprayed with lime to help reduce the acidity. He took the job at the dam because, he says, he has no other way to make a living, but now feels conflicted about working there. Copper mining has been the economic backbone of this region for more than a century. The metal makes up 70% of Zambia's exports and accounts for 15% of its GDP. The industry is set to grow further, with plans to more than triple production in Zambia by 2031, according to plans laid out by the government last year. In the village of Twalima, it has been a struggle to grow anything since the spill, say farmers Abigail Namtowe, 28, and Frederick Bwalya, 72. Farming was the main source of food and income for Ms Namtowe's family, and her six year-old daughter is now very hungry and malnourished, she told us. ""I've tried to grow my maize, I've tried everything so the hunger won't kill my child, but it's too much."" Mr Bwalya has lived in Twalima for 33 years. Strong and energetic, we meet him working on his farm which he tends to daily. ""Farming is not going well because the soil is not clean,"" he says. He also describes a severe pain in his leg which won't go away and makes it difficult for him to move. ""The doctor says the contaminated water could be causing this,"" he adds. Sino Metals has promised to build a borehole away from the contaminated stream at the bottom of his farm, he says, but that hasn't happened yet. He believes that water deeper underground would be safer. The stream used to be teeming with fish, say Mr Bwalya and his neighbours, adding that since the spill, there haven't been any. The BBC asked Sino Metals about the alleged promise to build boreholes on the land of affected farmers. We also put Lamec's allegations that he does not feel safe working at the company, but the firm did not respond. Fifty kilometres (31 miles) away from Frederick Bwalya's village, in Kamwatimpa, we saw schoolchildren swimming in a tributary of the Kafue river. Some mothers - still worried about the pollution - said they had told their children not to go into the water. But the government says it sampled 21 sites across Copperbelt Province in September, and that the concentrations of heavy metals were within national safe limits. Now the rainy season has taken hold, the power to stop a second wave of pollution seeping into the soil, and carrying heavy metals down the river to the rest of the country, is in the hands of the government and Sino Metals. The clean-up has been delayed by issues between the consultants hired to assess the damage and Sino Metals, Dr Chibamba told the BBC, when asked why some of this work hadn't been done earlier. Meanwhile, Dr Himwiinga warns that failure to deal with the situation ""may be catastrophic"". ""They [the heavy metals] could be there for years, and their effects could be felt for a very long period of time, by farmers... who rely on that water to irrigate their crops,"" she says. ""According to research carried out by Copperbelt University, this could go on for even over 10 years, unless remediation efforts are put in place."" The Zambian government says it is aware of this and has instructed Sino Metals to put mitigations in place to stop secondary pollution - including planting trees, to bring down levels of pollution in the air and soil, as well as spreading lime to reduce acidity. These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities. Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment. Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company. One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments. But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries. ""The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,"" says Prof Chan. ""The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans."" Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa. African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says. ""It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world."" African governments are ""not always getting it right"", he says, however ""this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make."" For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was ""grossly unfair"" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial. ""Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,"" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says. ""It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa."""
China US,Louvre to hike ticket prices for most non-EU tourists by 45%,2025-11-28T08:59:32.121Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd4llgrego,"Ticket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday. From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery. The museum's security and management have faced criticism since , when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes. An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure. From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum. Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC. The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added. The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum. There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026. Macron also said the to deal with overcrowding. Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo. The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros. Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics . The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration."
China US,Shein and Temu face calls for investigation over claims of stealing US designs,2025-12-02T09:52:28.694Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lvzeyk21vo,"Online retailers Shein and Temu are facing increased pressure in the US after two senior politicians pushed for investigations, including into claims of forced labour and intellectual property (IP) theft. In Texas, the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a probe into allegations of forced labour and the use of unsafe materials at Shein. At a national level, Senator Tom Cotton called for a federal investigation into possible IP theft at both Shein and Temu, which he labelled ""Communist Chinese"" platforms. Shein said it took concerns raised about its business practices seriously. Temu did not immediately respond for comment. Shein said in a statement that it would co-operate with the investigation and that it welcomed ""constructive engagement"" with Paxton. It said in response to Cotton's letter that the company continues to invest in protecting the rights of designers worldwide. ""We are constantly improving our internal processes to better protect creators,"" said Shein. The retailer is headquartered in Singapore but most of the goods sold on its platform are made in China, where it was founded. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, Cotton - senior Republican from Arkansas - said that millions of packages from China now sit in US warehouses after Washington changed its rules on low-cost shipments in August. , a global tariff exemption widely used by buyers of low-cost goods. The change subjected shipments to levies and stricter customs checks. The new regulations gives the Department of Justice and Homeland Security a ""golden opportunity"" to act, said Cotton, a key ally of Trump and a vocal critic of China. Designers and small American brands have accused Shein of systematically copying their original creations, often just days after launch, and selling them at a fraction of the price, he said. Cotton also accused Temu of carrying ""sophisticated and deceptive fakes"" on its platform, which has hundreds of millions of users. Cotton cited a which found a significant proportion of items that its researchers bought on Shein and Temu were likely counterfeits. Separately, Paxton from Texas said that numerous reports have raised serious concerns about Shein's alleged reliance on forced labour, and claims of the use of unsafe materials and deceptive marketing. The brand has been under scrutiny over the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business and the on its site. The Republican lawyer said the investigation will assess if Shein's practices violate Texas law by allegedly using hazardous materials and if it has misled consumers about ethical sourcing. The probe will also examine Shein's data collection practices, he added. ""I will not allow cheap, dangerous, foreign goods to flood America and jeopardise our health,"" said Paxton online. Shein also faces calls by the European Union to curb sales of childlike sex dolls and weapons on its third-party marketplace place after . Temu is also being investigated in France over the spread of harmful content accessible to young people. Shein is not the only firm under fire by Paxton, who, like Cotton, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. He and deceiving parents about the dangers that the platform is said to pose to young gamers. Roblox has denied the claims, which it said are based on ""misrepresentations"" of its online gaming platform."
China US,Aardman to celebrate 50 'cracking' years in home city,2025-12-02T15:54:45.446Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv34344y4o,"The animation studio behind Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run and Shaun the Sheep is celebrating 50 years in the business with a major new exhibition in its home city. Bristol-based Aardman Studios, famed for its stop-motion and clay modelling animation, was founded by school friends David Sproxton and Peter Lord. The ""Cracking Exhibition Gromit: 50 Years of Aardman in Bristol"" is due to take over the M Shed next summer, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, iconic characters and a celebration of the studio's ""deep-rooted connection"" to the city Ngaio Harding-Hill, from Aardman, said: ""2026 is such an important year for Aardman and the anniversary would never have been complete without a celebration in our home city."" ""The programme of experiences with M Shed and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery will be a real highlight celebrating the importance of Bristol, its people and creative connection to the studio over the last 50 years,"" he added. As part of the collaboration, ""Aardman treasures"" will also be hidden throughout Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Bristol Museums head of culture, Philip Walker, said they were ""absolutely delighted"" to be working with Aardman on this exciting collaboration. ""It's a brilliant celebration of Bristol's creative spirit and a tribute to the imagination and humour that Aardman has shared with the world for half a century,"" he said. ""We can't wait to showcase 50 years of clay, creativity, and cracking adventures."" The first Wallace And Gromit film was 1989's A Grand Day Out, which was followed by The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit and A Matter Of Loaf And Death. The studio's most recent film Vengeance Most Fowl, which saw the return of evil penguin Feathers McGraw, picked up two gongs at the Baftas awards ceremony and was also nominated for an Oscar."
China US,'I am devastated': Hong Kong residents in disbelief after fire destroys blocks of flats,2025-11-27T15:03:14.208Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjnlx1g6yo,"""When you get closer the heat rises and you can feel it and the smoke is really heavy."" Student Thomas Liu was one of many people drawn to the scene of a deadly fire that tore through much of the eight-block Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district. At least 83 people have died so far in the devastating blaze that began on Wednesday, and with hundreds still missing, this number is expected to rise. The cause is not yet known, but three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to flammable materials, including mesh and plastic sheets, that may have allowed the fire to spread quickly. ""It's a disaster,"" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. ""Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,"" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. The fire was gradually being contained but officials said they did not know when it would be fully extinguished. Flames could be seen coming from individual apartments as many people watched on in silence. One woman said her friends live inside the building and she was waiting to hear if they managed to get out. Harry Cheung, who has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for more than 40 years, told Reuters he heard ""a very loud noise"" and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. ""I immediately went back to pack up my things,"" the 66-year-old resident said. ""I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight because I probably won't be able to go back home."" A woman in her sixties, whose surname is Kam and who lives in the adjacent Kwong Fuk Estate, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that several of her friends living in Wang Fuk Court had been accounted for - but not all. One friend has daily afternoon naps and may have been sleeping when the fire broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT), Ms Kam said, adding that the woman's daughters have not yet been able to contact her. Another resident, 65-year-old Jason Kong, told Reuters that a neighbour called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. ""I am devastated. There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do. I hope the government can help us to settle down after this."" An elderly woman who lives in one of the affected blocks told the BBC she was not at home when the fire broke out but that she was worried about her apartment because it was not insured. ""I'm very upset that I have no home to go to now,"" she said. While the cause of the fire that engulfed the multiple high-rise blocks was unknown, police say a mesh material and plastic sheets were found outside the buildings - both of which are not believed to be fireproof. Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows. These materials may have caused the fire to spread more quickly, said police. Some people have expressed anger that such a massive fire could have happened and criticised the response. ""When there's a wildfire, they will deploy helicopters and drop water bombs, but why is there no such deployment and how can they leave other buildings burning?"" Ms Poon, another resident of Wang Fuk Court, who is in her sixties, asked. ""The community is so close to the fire station and we thought the fire could be put out soon, but now the fire has spread. I'm so disappointed,"" she told the SCMP. Ms Poon noted that she had been given no instructions from the government on where to seek help. The BBC spoke to some Tai Po residents who had brought supplies to the victims and affected residents - including dozens of blankets and heat packs. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said government departments were assisting residents affected by the fire. When asked about their feelings about the fire, the residents said ""the government is incompetent"" and that they were ""immensely heartbroken"". ""We don't want to see any more casualties,"" said one."
China US,COP30: Five key takeaways from a deeply divisive climate summit ,2025-11-23T00:10:18.355Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp84m16mdm1o,"In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive. Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated. The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change. Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the ""COP of truth"". The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted. And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting. Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible. So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP. The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations. Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that. While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return. Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas. To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion. It made matters worse. Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy. The EU were given short shrift by major producers. ""We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,"" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer. Ouch! Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse. Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP. These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain. They are the richest group of nations still in the but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour. While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of. The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft. The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the ""tripling"" word stayed in the text. So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in. ""Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,"" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics. ""This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union."" The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front. The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself. Two often heard positions: How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words? How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks? The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore. ""We can't discard it entirely,"" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News. ""But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far."" Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people. It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore. Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an ""implementation cop"" and put a lot of focus on the ""energy agenda"". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant. COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance. For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an ""orchestrated"" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G. 'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking. The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it. They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - ""unilateral"" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive. The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad. If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves. Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials. The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization. The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways. US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here. Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals. And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels. ""China kept a low political profile,"" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society. ""And they focussed on making money in the real world."" ""Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position."" to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

China US,Sixth-tier club contemplates second doc series,2025-11-23T12:32:40.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx5j096pxo,"A sixth-tier football club's owner says he is ""very close now to agreeing on series two"" of a documentary about his Sussex team. Eastbourne Borough Football Club has released the seven-episode Owning Eastbourne series on its YouTube channel. Cameras followed the club through the 2024-25 season, when the team lost in the National League South play-off semi-finals to Maidstone United. The club's owner Simon Leslie claims the first series of the documentary has ""had some really good interest"" from broadcasters since its release. It was broadcast on ReachTV, a channel shown in US airports, and the club is close to a deal to show the programme in China, according to Mr Leslie. The club owner told the BBC the documentary ""gives us an opportunity to share with people who want to get involved in what we're doing"". ""It's a very expensive business owning a football club,"" he said. ""I've had very broad shoulders for nearly three years and I need people to come in and support me, and help me, and be part of this journey."" He said viewers get ""a full, unfiltered view of behind the scenes, in the changing room, in the boardroom of what it's like in non-league football"". ""What's been really great over the last couple days is some of the comments have been incredibly positive,"" Mr Leslie said. ""There have been some less so comments as well, but it is like nothing else."" So far this season, Eastbourne have struggled in the National League South and currently find themselves in the relegation zone. Matt Gray, who was appointed in the summer, was sacked by the club in October and replaced by Tommy Widdrington for his second spell as manager of the club. Mr Leslie said the season so far had been ""a rollercoaster arc of emotions"" but he felt the team was ""on the up""."
China US,Dutch government suspends intervention into chipmaker Nexperia,2025-11-19T15:53:52.309Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p7j83rn1o,"The Dutch government has suspended its intervention at Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, following talks with China. The Hague over ""serious governance shortcomings"" and concerns over the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods. In response, Beijing blocked exports of the firm's chips. However, on Wednesday the Dutch government said it would halt its original decision following ""constructive talks"" with Beijing. China said it welcomed the move, adding it was a ""first step in the right direction towards a proper resolution"". Nexperia is a major supplier of basic computer chips to the car industry, and shortages have threatened global supply chains. A shortage of computer chips used in various electronic goods and cars would hugely impact the ability of manufacturers to make their products. The decision by the Dutch government will ease tensions between the European Union and China, which have been mounting in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. Vincent Karremans, economic affairs minister, said that he considered it right to suspend action, made under the Goods Availability Act, ahead of further talks with the Chinese government. ""We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement. The Dutch government said it originally invoked the Act following concerns ""from actions attributed to the now-suspended CEO, involving the improper transfer of product assets, funds, technology, and knowledge to a foreign entity"". ""These actions ran counter to the interests of the company, its shareholders, and Dutch and European strategic autonomy and security of supply,"" it said. In October, a Dutch court ordered the removal of ex-Nexperia CEO and Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng, citing alleged mismanagement. The Dutch government added that its decision had aimed to prevent a situation in which chips could become unavailable in an emergency. In December last year, the US government placed Wingtech, which owns Nexperia, on its so-called ""entity list"", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. Following the Dutch government's reversal, the Beijing acknowledged the move but said it was ""still a step away from addressing the root cause of the global semiconductor supply chain turmoil and chaos"". ""Furthermore, the erroneous ruling by the corporate court, spearheaded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, to strip Wingtech of its control over Nexperia remains a key obstacle to resolving the issue,"" it added. Wingtech has said it will fight the decision. Following the latest move, a spokesperson for Wingtch said the company ""strongly"" rejected the allegations against its chief executive. ""To date, no proof has been provided,"" it added. ""If the Dutch government is sincere about solving the problem, the Ministry should now file a letter with the Enterprise Chamber, explicitly withdrawing its support for the proceedings. ""These proceedings form a threat to the continuity of Nexperia B.V. and therefore for the economic security of the Netherlands and Europe - which is the exact same argument the Dutch government made previously in support of judicial intervention."""
China US,Strange pillar of light linked to Chinese rocket,2025-12-06T12:02:15.539Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98ze8jx7o,"A glowing streak spotted in the sky on Thursday morning was most likely caused by a Chinese rocket, experts say. Witnesses reported a bright, linear trail visible around dawn and dusk from several locations. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the US, said: ""It was definitely the Chinese Zhuque-3 rocket making its first test flight. ""It passed over the UK and northern Europe at around 05:00 GMT at the end of its first orbit, following launch from China at 04:02 GMT. Chinese upper stages have been previously observed to make long, linear propellant-dump trails."" Ellie Jarvis, from Clovelly, said: ""I've never seen anything like it. At first, I wondered whether it might be something like an aurora or a natural phenomenon - like a light pillar. ""I tried to see whether there was something shining a beam of light from across the bay, or perhaps from a ship - but that didn't  seem likely as the light seemed to be so high in the sky."" A jet contrail was also considered but dismissed because the trail appeared too widespread. Similar vertical light effects, known as light pillars, can sometimes form when high-altitude ice crystals reflect low-angle sunlight, creating unusual atmospheric displays."
China US,What we know about the Hong Kong apartment fires,2025-11-28T09:47:59.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxe9r7wjgro,"Hong Kong's deadliest fire in more than 60 years ripped through a high-rise public housing complex in the city's north-east this week, killing at least 128 people. Dozens more remain missing, with 79 people confirmed injured and and 89 bodies yet to be identified. Now, as the last flames are extinguished and the high-rise blocks smoulder against the city's urban skyline, attention has turned to the cause of the deadly fire, and the factors that allowed it to so rapidly spread. Many Hong Kongers have described it as a ""man-made disaster"". Authorities have attributed the ferocity of the blaze to Styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks - while also noting that fire alarms in all eight housing blocks were found to be not working effectively. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire, according to local media reports, and an investigation has been launched. What initially caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far. The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT). Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, each 31 storeys high. Seven have been affected by the fire, Tai Po district councillor Mui Siu-fung told BBC Chinese. Built in 1983, the tower blocks were undergoing renovations when the fire broke out. Tai Po is a residential district in the northern part of Hong Kong, near the city of Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland. The complex provides 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of the people who lived in the Wang Fuk Court housing complex are at least 65, or older, according to the latest census. Some of them have lived in the subsidised public housing estate since it was built. The cause of the fire is unknown, but Hong Kong Security Chief Tang Ping-Keung on Friday attributed its rapid spread to styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks. A preliminary investigation previously found that the blaze had escalated unusually fast, and police had revealed that a mesh material and plastic sheets - both of which are believed to not be fireproof - was found on the outside of the buildings. Police have arrested three men aged between 52 and 68 on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the deadly blaze. Two of them are directors of a construction firm while the other is an engineering consultant. A police spokesperson on Thursday said investigators were looking into the alleged actions, or failure to act, of the firm's top officials. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" said the spokesperson. Authorities on Friday further noted that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working effectively - confirming prior reports from some residents who said they did not sound when the blaze broke out. This was Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years. Within 40 minutes of first being reported it was declared a level four alarm - but it was raised to a level five, the highest in severity, about three and a half hours later. Local media had earlier reported that explosions could be heard inside the building and fire hoses could not easily reach the higher levels. The ferocity of the heat had prevented firefighters from entering the buildings. Officials told reporters on Friday that even after the fire had been put out, some sections of the buildings' remained above 200C (392F). The city's fire department on Thursday said that the combination of high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments made rescue operations difficult Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have an average living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out. Hundreds were evacuated to temporary shelters, and some were allocated emergency housing units. More than 2,311 firefighters took part in rescue operations, with 12 sustaining injuries during the response. Authorities said 391 fire engines were also mobilised and 188 ambulances dispatched. Among the dead is firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, who was with the service at Sha Tin Fire Station for nine years. The fire service says it lost contact with him at 15:30 local time, and about half an hour later, found that he had collapsed. He was taken to hospital but declared dead shortly after. ""I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,"" said Andy Yeung, director of the fire service. One resident, Mr Chung, told the BBC he got a panicked phone call on Wednesday afternoon from his wife saying she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Mr Chung said he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. to accommodate residents who were evacuated, the government said. The South China Morning Post reported that one of them - at Tung Cheong Street Sports Centre - was full, and residents were being directed to other shelters. Another, the Kwong Fuk Community Hall, which is just over the road from the housing estate, was deemed unsafe. Evacuees were moved to another shelter, further away. BBC Chinese reporter Gemini Cheng saw elderly residents, some using walking sticks or wheelchairs, arriving at some of the shelters. At least 900 people are taking shelter in such temporary facilities, news agency AFP reports, quoting Lee. Six schools in Tai Po will remain closed on Thursday, the Education Bureau announced, . An emergency monitoring and support centre is in operation to manage the impact of the fire, security secretary Tang Ping-keung said in a statement. A hotline for the public to ask about casualties has been set up by Hong Kong police. The tower blocks at Wang Fuk Court are covered in bamboo scaffolding and green construction netting, right up to the rooftops, because they are undergoing renovations. As mentioned earlier, authorities have attributed the quick spread of the fire to materials used in the renovation, such as mesh netting, plastic sheeting and styrofoam. It's still unclear how the fire began, but no matter its cause, proper netting on the buildings' exterior would have been key to preventing its spread, Jason Poon, chairman of construction NGO Chinat Monitor, told news outlet Initium Media. Substandard netting could cause the fire to spread rapidly, he added. Another engineer told Initium Media he believes that the vast majority of mesh netting used in construction across Hong Kong is not made of fire-retardant material. Cardboard, debris and paint thinner is also often found on the scaffolding, which along with dry weather could hasten the spread of fire, the engineer said. One fire safety expert the BBC spoke to said the bamboo scaffolding - a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. Authorities have not mentioned scaffolding as having caused or fuelled the rapid spread of the fire. Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong, although reports said these were caused by falls and other safety failures, rather than fires. Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were ""relatively old"" - they were built in the 1980s - so ""the glass windows are not that fire resilient"". ""The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane... [which makes it] very easy to be broken by the flames and the flames can then penetrate through the facade."""
China US,'Hang in there': Agonising wait for the missing after Hong Kong blaze,2025-11-28T07:11:58.245Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9y0pjzmdro,"""Hang in there."" Those were the last words Mr Chung said to his wife after a huge 's Tai Po district. It was around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday when he got her panicked phone call. She said she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Firefighters in the Chinese territory took nearly 24 hours to tame the blaze that tore through seven tower blocks, including theirs, claiming at least 128 lives so far. Nearly 300 people are still unaccounted for - Mr Chung's wife is among the many missing. The BBC spoke to several residents who were not at home or managed to escape in time. Some, like Mr Chung, have waited outside the burning buildings, hoping against hope. There was no alarm warning them of danger, all of them told the BBC. Mr Chung, 45, and his brother, spent Wednesday night on the street asking the firefighters dozens of times for updates - but they couldn't give them any. Throughout, he said, he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. The Chungs moved in a decade ago to Wang Cheong House – the first of the seven tower blocks at Tai Po to go up in flames. When the fire started, Mr Chung says, the smoke on the 23rd floor, where they lived, turned so thick within just 10 minutes, that his wife couldn't find her way out. The cause of the fire is still unclear, but authorities believe renovations using flammable material and scaffolding helped spread what has now become the deadliest blaze in Hong Kong in six decades. It engulfed seven of the eight buildings - comprising 1,800 units - in Wang Fuk Court, a subsidised housing estate built in 1983 to the north of Hong Kong Island, where the city's wealthy live. Nearly 40% of Wang Fuk Court's residents are aged 65 or above, according to the 2021 census. It's partly why it's feared so many residents were trapped - because they are older and less likely to have made it out quickly. Ms Fung, 40, has not been able to find her mother yet. She and her parents moved to the estate only last year - for its views of the ocean. Her father and she were at work when the fire started. Ms Fung received a call from her neighbour, who said she was hiding with Ms Fung's mother inside a toilet. But they lost contact at midnight on Wednesday. All the same, she is holding on to hope: ""We will think about our next steps after my mum comes out."" She sought help from police, but she says she was furious when they called her back to ask if it was possible her mother could have somehow escaped. She demanded to know how that was possible: ""You know much better than us how badly burnt Wang Cheong House is!"" On social media, posts about missing elderly relatives, children and pets have been circulating endlessly. A desperate mother wrote: ""I still can't find my baby girl. It's nearly 30 hours and there has been no updates from the fire service…"" In a later post, she said: ""I am afraid there is no hope."" The devastation has spotlighted the expensive and controversial renovations at Wang Fuk Court, which cost about HK$330M ($42.2M; £32.1M), with each household having to pay between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000. Many residents had opposed the project because of the costs but it went ahead. Authorities have now arrested three executives from the construction firm, citing ""gross negligence"".  Police say the mesh and plastic sheets used on the scaffolding were substandard, and that windows were wrapped in highly flammable styrofoam. Grandma Chan, a long-time resident, says she had been scared since the renovation began last year, because of its scale and she had occasionally noticed a burning smell. ""Will anything happen if I stay home?"" she once asked her daughter. The 72-year-old was alone at home when the fire started but she only found out about it when her daughter, who was travelling in South Korea, called. She says she made it out alive because her daughter told her to flee. It was the same for 82-year-old Grandma Wu. When the fire broke out, she was playing mahjong, a popular game, with her neighbours. They were warned not by an alarm, but by their husbands calling them. But she said they continued the game because there were three buildings between theirs and Wang Cheong House, where the fire broke out. Then came a second call, saying the fire had reached their building. The women immediately took the lift and reached the ground floor. Surrounded by the smell of burning buildings, Grandma Wu looked up to find that seven of eight buildings within the complex were in flames. Although she was safe, she stayed outside, with her helper, overnight. She says her son wanted to take her to his home but she refused. ""I have been living in this flat for 42 years,"" she says. ""I told my son not to come, and I would not go anywhere. I have to sit here and watch how this goes. My heart will only be at peace after the fire is extinguished."" When that happens, a new battle begins for many residents who have poured a life's worth of savings into buying these homes. Kyle Ho, 32, moved into the complex with his retired parents three years ago. Despite the subsidised price, they needed a mortgage to afford a home at Wang Fuk Court. Now, they don't know what comes next. The Hong Kong government has announced cash relief of HK$10,000 for displaced families, and a HK$300m assistance fund. That could be some relief for Mr Ho. ""The worst-case scenario is that we have lost our flat,"" he says. ""But the most important thing is that all of us are safe. We are luckier than many other families."" For those like Mr Chung, the wait continues as authorities insist they have not ruled out rescuing people. ""We haven't given up,"" they said earlier on Thursday. Mr Chung, too, is determined to find his wife. ""I want to rescue her - whether she's alive or gone."""
China US,Cats became our companions much later than you think,2025-11-27T20:02:21.954Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8dvdp9gn7o,"In true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place. A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. ""They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,"" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford. ""That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago."" All modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat. How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists. To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats. The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa. ""Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,"" said Prof Larson. This fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies. Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought. They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China. Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica. And in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene. These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years. The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially ""commensal"" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. ""Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,"" she said. Leopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia. Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s. The research is published in the journal, and in ."
China US,"Graduate jobs under threat from AI, PwC boss says",2025-11-21T02:34:57.601Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm272510e6jo,"The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) may eventually lead to fewer entry-level graduates being hired, the boss of accountancy giant PwC has told the BBC. However, global chairman Mohamed Kande said AI was not behind recent job cuts at the firm, adding that the company actually needed to hire hundreds of new AI engineers but was struggling to find them. But some observers say the technology itself threatens thousands of junior jobs across the professional services industry. Speaking on the sidelines of a business summit in Singapore, Mr Kande also said big changes in the global economy, such as US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, had been good for the firm's consulting business. He also addressed the company's suspension in China last year over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande, promising that the same mistakes ""would not happen again"". Headquartered in London, PwC is one of the Big Four accountancy firms. It provides a range of services, such as financial auditing, consulting and tax advice for business clients around the world. According to Mr Kande, advising them on how to integrate AI into their operations will be at the heart of the firm's future business strategy, even as the rapidly advancing technology affects its own hiring plans. Firms who would have previously hired PwC consultants to sift through data and documents may now use AI models instead, turning weeks of costly work into mere minutes. Every year, the company hires thousands of new graduates in entry-level positions - including 1,300 in the UK and 3,200 in the US last year - but it recently dropped long-term plans to continue increasing its headcount. In 2021, PwC said it wanted to hire 100,000 people over the course of five years - but Mr Kande said this would no longer be possible. ""When we made the plans to hire that many people, the world looked very, very different,"" he said. ""Now we have artificial intelligence. We want to hire, but I don't know if it's going to be the same level of people that we hire - it will be a different set of people."" Last year, PwC cut more than 5,600 roles across its worldwide operation. The boss of the company's UK business has previously spoken about reducing graduate recruitment, admitting that AI was ""certainly reshaping roles"". At a global level, however, Mr Kande insisted that the AI boom was an ""exciting time"" for creating new jobs. ""We are looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers today to help us drive our AI agenda, but we just cannot find them,"" he said. Businesses around the world may be facing challenges adapting to AI, but in the meantime PwC appears to have benefited from the broader uncertainty in the global economy, largely fuelled by President Trump's extensive use of tariffs. ""We are receiving a lot of calls from many companies around the world asking how to navigate the current environment,"" said Mr Kande. ""It's been good for us. We need to remain relevant to our clients and we have to be in these discussions, which we are."" However, the company took a huge reputational blow last year, when over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande. The firm went bust after amassing debts of more than $300bn (£230bn) and has been at the centre of a ruinous housing crisis that continues to damage lives and livelihoods in China. The country's Securities Regulatory Commission found that PwC, as the auditor, had ""covered up and even condoned"" financial fraud at Evergrande. Mr Kande, whose tenure as global chairman began after Evergrande went bankrupt, said PwC no longer faced any restrictions in China. ""Let me tell you - we changed many of our people, implemented new quality management systems and introduced new governance systems,"" he said. ""My focus has been to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."""
China US,Meta accused of letting AI sellers 'run rampant',2025-11-29T07:01:17.149Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz90d4q0o,"Facebook owner Meta has been accused of allowing misleading companies to ""run rampant"" on its platforms, as dozens of people say they have fallen victim to sellers using AI-generated adverts. More than 60 people contacted the BBC after we revealed unscrupulous foreign firms were . Some said they had been targeted by ads on Facebook and Instagram, and consumer guide Which? said businesses were using the platforms to ""spread their lies furthest and widest"". Meta said it had removed content by six companies, flagged by the BBC, which claimed to be based in England but were shipping cheap goods in from Asia. The tech giant said it did not allow fraudulent activity and worked closely with Stop Scams UK to protect users. One company removed from the platform is C'est La Vie, but had a returns address in China. Mabel & Daisy, which used AI generated pictures of a mother and daughter and claimed to sell ""timeless clothing"" from a shop in Bristol, has also been removed from the platform after it was exposed for selling cheap items from a base in Hong Kong. Other companies Meta says it is taking action against are clothing firms Sylvia & Grace, Chester & Claire, Harrison & Hayes and Olyndra London, as well as accessories business Omelia & Oliver Jewels. All have one-star reviews on Trustpilot with hundreds of customers saying they were duped into thinking they were buying from UK-based brands and received shoddy goods. Harrison & Hayes claimed to be a Manchester-based independent clothes shop with ""decades of experience"" but has a returns address to a central warehouse in China. It has used an AI-image of a shop front in the city which does not exist. Chester & Clare also uses an AI-generated image of a shopfront to market its business, which it claims has operated in London since 2005 but is actually based in the Netherlands and sells clothes shipped from China. Its terms of service states imagery, stories, characters and boutique locations ""may have been created using generate AI"" to ""enhance customer experience"". The BBC contacted all businesses but only got automated responses. Claire Brown was persuaded to buy two dresses for £73 from Luxe and Luna London, after ""constantly"" seeing the company's appealing adverts on Facebook. When the dresses arrived weeks later they were poorly made of flimsy material and ""looked awful"". ""It felt like a trusted brand after I'd seen it on Facebook so much, you see all these clothing collections and I liked what I saw,"" she said. Ms Brown, who works in tech marketing, said she reported the company to Meta but never got a response. The company has now stopped operating, with stating life had ""taken a devastating turn"" because of the death of a partner, an almost identical statement used by fake Birmingham jewellery business C'est La Vie. ""It makes me feel really cross, because I hate people being scammed and the websites are the kind of thing you would share with a friend,"" Claire added. ""There is a real lack of protection here for consumers."" Another Facebook user, Stuart, said he had reported a number of suspicious companies to the platform but was advised to ""influence the ads that you see by hiding ads and changing your ad preferences"" in its response. No other action was taken. Some of the fraudulent companies discovered by the BBC appear to be . That's where a third-party buys products from a wholesaler and sells them with a significant mark-up, having never seen the product themselves. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) recently that used images of roses, cobbled streets and the union jack when it was shipping goods from a warehouse in Asia. The regulator said it was continuing to take action on misleading adverts but said platforms like Facebook played an ""important role"" in maintaining ""responsible advertising"" and continued to engage with them on how best to prevent those that break the rules. Which? said Meta had allowed fake companies to ""run rampant on its platforms for too long"" and said it should be doing ""much more"" to stop scams and protect its users. Meta said it wanted users to report suspicious adverts on its platforms, which was an ""important signal"" to its review systems and could prompt a re-review of the advert while improving policies."
China US,Mum and baby fire plea sent to woman in Manchester,2025-11-28T19:08:29.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0nld5v87zo,"A woman in Manchester said she received pleas for help from a mum who was stuck in a Hong Kong flat fire with her newborn baby. At least after the and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. The cause of the fire remains unclear though officials said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread. Cherry moved to Manchester three years ago but she grew up in the complex and is still on a residents' group chat where she saw the pleas for help. Cherry said she did not sleep on Wednesday night. ""I felt really really sad because I knew I couldn't do anything,"" she said. ""I was seeing messages from people still in the fire asking for help, pleading to be saved. ""What I most strongly remember was a mother - she was in the fire with her three-month-old baby, messaging for help. She told us the address and said 'please help to save us'. ""A lot of people downstairs were writing support to her, telling her how to keep stable and calm until the firemen came."" Cherry told Radio Manchester that the mother and baby were rescued and were safe and well. ""They are in hospital for monitoring,"" she said. But Cherry said they were not the only residents who were trapped like this. Cherry said she believed ongoing maintenance work, flammable materials and a lack of working fire alarms were responsible for the scale of the tragedy. ""There is green mesh outside the building because of the maintenance work,"" she said. ""However in Hong Kong there is no understanding that this mesh needed to be fire resistant. ""The residents say they have tested the mesh nets and found out that the material was not fire resistant and they are angry. ""They are thinking about how they pay so much money but didn't get what they needed, didn't get anything to protect their lives."" Authorities are investigating the incident.

China US,"Britain won't beat the US in AI race, says ex-Google scientist",2025-11-24T06:43:20.856Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e7mj0jmro,"A computer scientist who revolutionised the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has called for the UK to be ""brave"" in its pursuit of the technology. Llion Jones, who was part of the pioneering Google team that unlocked AI's ability to respond in a human-like form, warned against trying to compete with ""hyper-scalers"" in the United States and China. He said the ""sycophantic"" responses of the current wave of AI chatbots needed to be fixed. ""We need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you,"" he said. Mr Jones, who was raised in Bangor and Abergynolwyn in Gwynedd, north Wales, is one of the co-authors of , which introduced the Transformer architecture that put the ""T"" in ChatGPT. It was a breakthrough that now underpins the generative AI systems that are transforming business and everyday life. Still based in Tokyo, he is now the chief technology officer of Sakana AI, the firm he founded with another former Google researcher. His company focuses on speculative research into future uses of AI, something he claimed was ""unique"", as other big tech firms were focused on monetising the current wave of large language models. ""I do genuinely think that we are unique in that respect right now,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I'm trying to make the environment to give people the freedom to do the research they want, and I'm going to try and protect it as long as I can."" Mr Jones said governments in Cardiff and Westminster needed to accept the reality of a global race which was being won by America and China, and focus instead on different types of AI developments. ""I think a country like Wales, or even Britain in general, is not going to beat the hyper-scalers, right? They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs. ""It doesn't make any sense to be a part of that race, because you're not going to win. ""So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave."" He argued that ""something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research"". ""It's a bit of a longer bet, but if it pays off then you're back in the race, right?"" While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations. Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology. ""AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,"" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle. Some of the businesses at the event ""are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,"" he added. ""If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,"" Kyle said. He added that a 1% increase in small business productivity would generate £240bn worth of economic activity. AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to ""drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive"". It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology. Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government. But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales. There have been to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas. ""Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,"" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons. Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands. ""What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,"" he said. ""There's so much more benefit that comes from the modernisation of grid infrastructure. ""When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible."" Mr George warned Wales could ""lose out"" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions. Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant ""the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly"". While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots. ""They've become very sycophantic,"" he said. The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them. ""Unfortunately, humans love being told that they're right. ""This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.' ""So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you."""
China US,Trump's plan for Gaza backed by UN Security Council,2025-11-18T02:03:30.771Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpkgq4wllo,"The UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza. Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained. Adopting it was an ""important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire"", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan ""imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject"". ""Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,"" it added. Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas. Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be ""tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians"". The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force. Trump called the Security Council vote ""historic"" and said it was a way of ""acknowledging and endorsing"" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. ""This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for. Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text. The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to ""translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground"" and lead to ""a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution"". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution. The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented ""urgently and immediately"". Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it. Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution. The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a ""fragile, fragile first step"". Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack. More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
China US,'My heart breaks every time I'm called a hero' - Hong Kong fire survivor,2025-12-03T23:13:49.458Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2054rdv52o,"William Li has struggled with the label ""hero"" since helping his neighbours escape the fire which engulfed the Hong Kong block of flats he had called home since birth. Instead, he is haunted by guilt that he could have saved more people from the blaze at Wang Fuk Court, which left at least 159 people dead. ""My heart breaks every time someone calls me a hero,"" says the 40-year-old, breaking down in tears. A week on from the disaster, firefighters are still combing the complex of seven burnt-out high rises for the remains of 30 of Mr Li's neighbours - people who, like him, had the misfortune to be at home when the deadly fire began. What caused the fire to start, and why more people did not escape, is now the subject of an independent committee's investigation, ordered by Hong Kong's chief executive. Already, it has been revealed that non-fire resistant netting had been fitted around the building, and the fire alarms were not working properly. The fact alarms did not go off was the reason why Mr Li was not more worried when his wife called to tell him a fire had started in their building, Wang Cheong House. Instead of rushing, he spent almost 10 minutes packing belongings. But the moment he opened the door, the extent of the disaster was all too clear: he was engulfed in billowing smoke and had to retreat inside his flat. On the other end of the phone, his wife became hysterical, but Mr Li didn't have time to panic. He had to put wet towels under the door to stop the smoke from getting in, and tried to work out what to do next. It was then he heard voices in the corridor, where the air was now so dense with smoke he was unable to see who was calling out. Covering his face with a wet towel, he found two of his neighbours by touch, dragging the couple inside to the relative safety of his flat. In a neighbouring block, Bai Shui Lin was also trying to help her neighbours. The 66-year-old is thought to have saved at least three families, banging on their doors to warn them of the fire. Mrs Bai did not survive, however. Her sons identified her body at the weekend. ""If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,"" Yip Ka-Kui told the BBC's US partner, CBS. ""But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others."" Back in Mr Li's flat, the middle aged couple revealed they had heard another voice in the corridor: a domestic worker calling for an elderly woman. But now, the voice had gone quiet. This time, Mr Li was unable to help. ""I feel very guilty,"" he said. ""Some people weren't saved and I didn't open my door again and try to find them."" Mr Li does not know yet what happened to the voice in the corridor. Nine Indonesian and one Filipino domestic workers are reportedly among the dead, but others survived - including Rhodora Alcaraz, 28, who was trapped in another flat looking after her employer's three-month-old baby and elderly mother. She too has been hailed a hero for staying by their side. All three were rescued by firefighters eventually - but not before Ms Alcaraz had sent a series of voice messages to her sister. ""I'm feeling very weak. I can't breathe,"" she said in one of the clips, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Li and the couple - named in local media as the Chows - realised they too needed to escape. Several hours had elapsed, and their options were running out. One fire exit was blocked by the flames, while Mr Li's neighbour believed the other was locked. They decided not to jump out of the second floor window due to the intensity of the fire, and the constant explosions. A subsidiary of Danish company ISS, the property manager of Wang Fuk Court, has not responded to a BBC inquiry over reports that the emergency exit was locked. ""It was the first time I felt death had something to do with me,"" says Mr Li. That's why he started saying goodbye to friends one by one via WhatsApp: ""I can't escape,"" he told them. ""If something happens to me take care of my children. Look after yourselves."" About two and a half hours after the blaze began, firefighters finally reached them on an aerial ladder. Mrs Chow told HK01, a Hong Kong-based news outlet, that Mr Li insisted the firefighters should get them out first. ""We are older and told him he should leave first. He refused and said he was young and could handle this."" When the firefighters came back for him, Mr Li felt reluctant to leave his home, which was filled with fond memories and treasured collections of photography equipment and toys. ""The fire was telling me that I couldn't take anything away, that I had no right or power to stop it from devouring everything."" Mr Li reunited with his family at a nearby fast food restaurant. But after he'd reached hospital it took until the early hours of the morning for the true extent of the horror he'd endured to make itself felt. ""I no longer had any strength in me and when I got to the emergency room, my knees gave in. A burning smell lingered in my nose,"" he says. ""I really wanted to wash away the smell."" After being admitted to a ward at 03:00, Mr Li finally had the space to cry and start trying to process the ordeal he had gone through. ""When I had been to hospital before, I wanted to go home as soon as possible,"" he says. ""But this time when the nurse asked me [if I wanted to go home], I wasn't willing to leave. I felt like I was avoiding what I would have to face in the future."" He has however decided to face the trauma upfront – by doing as many interviews as he can. ""I hope many people will come forward to help find the truth,"" he says. ""I hope Wang Fuk Court residents will be given answers and justice."""
China US,Gardeners unearth stolen phones left by snatchers,2025-11-25T06:00:33.440Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vm6p3vjd2o,"Volunteers at a community garden in central London have been reuniting phone theft victims with their stolen devices after finding them buried in flower-beds. The Phoenix Garden, off Shaftesbury Avenue in Covent Garden, has seen snatchers stash stolen phones in its grounds due to its proximity to the West End, in an issue first reported by . Garden volunteers said they collected the phones from bushes and flower-beds and handed them to their owners or the police. As a result, fewer devices have been unearthed in recent weeks. Louise Gates, Phoenix Garden manager, said she often found phones ""thrown over the fence from the night before"" when she unlocked the garden in the morning. ""Some of our volunteers have dug up phones wrapped in tin foil,"" Ms Gates added. Tinfoil is often used by phone snatchers to stop the device's location being detected. It is believed that snatchers, often on electric bikes around hotspot areas like Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, have been temporarily stashing the phones in the garden for collection at a later date. Ms Gates said some of the theft victims had arrived at the garden after tracking their device's signal through Apple's Find My app. Ms Gates said if she could find the emergency contact information on the phone, she called the number provided. ""They're all really so grateful, which is nice,"" she said. ""Other times I charge it up, but nobody rings, I don't know who it belongs to or I can't find them on social media, so I just take it to the police station."" Ron Chenery, a volunteer of two years, said finding phones was a regular occurrence. ""Most of us love the garden so much, we're constantly out in the fresh air. If we see something we hand it in,"" he said. Community worker Elliot Hughes, who helps local students access the garden and get into nature, said it was important to teach young people about the wider risks of phone theft across the capital. ""The best we can do is give awareness"" he said. ""There's young people now, walking around central London on their phones, in the middle of the street, which are essentially £1,000 computers. ""So [I am] just highlighting to them maybe the things they shouldn't be doing."" A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said local officers had stepped up patrols in the area to identify potential phone snatching offenders. ""By intensifying our efforts we're catching more perpetrators and protecting people from having their phone stolen in the capital and have reduced theft by 16% since April. ""We're also dismantling organised crime groups suspected of large-scale phone theft."" The force called on phone companies including Apple and Samsung for security improvements that would make stolen phones harder to sell."
China US,Putin says Russia ready to supply 'uninterrupted' fuel to India ,2025-12-05T12:50:31.387Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g482m3yyzo,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide ""uninterrupted shipments"" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil. Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow. President Donald Trump has imposed , arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies. Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a ""peaceful solution"" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas ""Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,"" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on ""the side of peace"", welcoming efforts to find a ""lasting"" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the ""connectivity"" of Russia and India was a ""major priority"" for India. In recent months, India-US ties have hit an as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"" at the time. In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US. ""The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,"" he asked. Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May. The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture. Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia. Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said. No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry. Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years. Modi said that ""energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership"", but made no specific reference to oil. India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions. Putin also referenced a ""flagship project"": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with. In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being ""reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms"". Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a ""more just"" and ""multi-polar"" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations."
China US,Zambian-American influencer sentenced to 18 months for hate speech,2025-12-02T14:58:51.583Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqnklqge7o,"A Zambian-American influencer and political vlogger has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech for making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema. Zambian-born Ethel Chisono Edwards, who also holds US citizenship and works as an estate agent in New York, has a large following across various social media accounts. Known as ""One Boss Lady"", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years. The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral. She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments. But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common. Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year. She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred. Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential. He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment. He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf. ""I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,"" it said. Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona. The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest. Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence. The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech. Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws. In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema."
China US,Namibia loses bid to overturn ban on rhino horn trade,2025-12-05T14:24:32.464Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30j7q6qjp9o,"Namibia's proposals to lift the ban on the international trade in black and white rhino horns have been rejected at a key conservation meeting. The result of the voting at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) earlier this week was adopted by the conference on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Namibia had also proposed overturning the ban on African savanna elephant ivory - this too was defeated. Eyebrows were raised about the rhino horn trade proposals mainly because Namibia pioneered the practice of cutting the horns off rhinos in 1989 so they no longer have value for poachers. Dehorning was followed by other southern African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa. Rhino horns are prized in traditional Asian medicine and are also status symbols in China, Vietnam, and some other south-east Asian countries. Namibia tabled two separate proposals - one for black rhinos and the other for southern white rhino. Both were resoundingly defeated, with only around 30 votes out of about 120 in favour. Cites regulations require a two-thirds majority for a proposal to be adopted. Black rhinos are listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2023, there were only 6,421 alive - a decline of more than 90% since 1960, according to an IUCN report. The southern white rhinos are not in quite such danger - they are listed as near threatened, with a population of  15,752. But this is down 11% since 2023 and at its lowest point since the current rhino poaching crisis began nearly two decades ago. Cites banned the trade in the horns and other rhino parts in 1977 but their poaching continued with more than 8,000 lost in the last decade, according to Save the Rhino International. In Namibia, the number of rhinos poached was the highest on record in 2022, with 87 killed - almost twice as many as the year before, government data shows. Although this was the first time that Namibia tabled the two proposals seeking the lifting of the ban on the rhino horn trade, the country has backed similar proposals by other southern African countries including South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe in the past. Experts say the main reason these countries want the ban to be lifted is because of the huge stockpiles of rhino horns they have amassed over the years. ""Namibia and other pro-trade rhino range states have amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn they wish to trade,"" Taylor Tench, senior wildlife policy analyst with the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the BBC. ""Namibia's stockpiles are an estimated 6.45 tonnes of white rhino horn and an estimated 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horn. South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much."" The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme. The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed. The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless. But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly. As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating. ""The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,"" said Mr Tench. ""Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised."" The governments of both countries have been approached for comment. Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts. Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures. But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching. They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues. Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN. South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said."

China US,China exempts chips used by carmakers from export curbs,2025-11-10T07:02:17.905Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rp2514g4qo,"China has lifted export controls on computer chips vital to car production, the country's commerce ministry said on Sunday. Exemptions have been granted to exports made by Chinese-owned Nexperia for civilian use, it said, which should help carmakers who had feared production in Europe would be hit. At the same time, China has also paused an export ban to the US of some materials that are crucial in the semiconductor industry and suspended port fees for American ships. The moves mark an easing of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed in October to reduce tariffs on each other and pause other measures for a year. In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by Chinese company Wingtech, to try to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other goods. In response, China blocked exports of the firm's finished chips. However, it said earlier this month as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China. While Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. When it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to ""serious governance shortcomings"" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency. But when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues. In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted. Earlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that ""supply shortages were imminent"". Volvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business. But on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic that China had agreed to ""the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips"" and it would ""grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter"" provided the goods were for ""civilian use"". ""Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows."" , China's commerce ministry called on ""the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible."" Prof David Bailey from Birmingham University's business school told the BBC's Today programme that the actions of China were a ""wake-up call"" for the motor industry. ""The Dutch government may well have had good reasons to try and take control but it hadn't thought through the implications of that,"" he said. ""The retaliation from China was swift and it was brutal."" He said there was a need to find alternative processing sites, ""maybe in south east Asia, or Europe"", and for the industry to keep bigger stocks of its products in case of shortages. Meanwhile, the suspension of a ban on exports of ""dual-use items"" related to gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials to the US came into effect on Sunday and will be in place until 27 November, 2026. The ban on the exports of goods and materials that can have both civilian and military uses was announced in December 2024. China's transport ministry also said port fees charged on US-linked ships would be suspended for a for a year, effective 0501 GMT Monday. On Friday, China also announced the suspension of other export controls related to expanded curbs on some rare earth materials and lithium batteries."
China US,Reform or rights rollback? India's sweeping labour law overhaul sparks debate,2025-11-28T00:00:09.578Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwk28d5yzxo,"Last week, India announced it would implement what many say are its most far-reaching economic reforms in decades - compressing 29 federal laws that regulated labour into . As a result, the number of rules that govern labour have now come down from a staggering 1,400 to around 350, while the number of forms companies had to fill in this regard have reduced from 180 to 73 - drastically lightening the regulatory burden on businesses. The laws got a parliamentary nod in 2020 but are finally set to be uniformly implemented across the country after a five-year delay and much political wrangling. Companies - which have long blamed restrictive labour practices for the atrophy in India's manufacturing sector - have given the changes a rousing welcome. ""This is part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of Trump's 50% tariffs, and an important signal that it is keen to ease doing business in India, attract more FDI [foreign direct investment] and integrate into GVCs [global value chains],"" said Nomura, a broking house. But trade unions are asking for their withdrawal and calling the codes the most ""sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers' hard-won rights and entitlements since [India's] independence"". The changes have triggered demonstrations across the country, with 200-300 people turning up at a protest in capital Delhi on Wednesday, led largely by left-leaning trade unions not aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. At the protest site, Akashdeep Singh, a 33-year-old factory worker employed at an international beverage company on the outskirts of Delhi, told the BBC that ""the laws will benefit only the employers and not workers like us"". Several others expressed similar anxieties. The government says the long-pending reforms aim to modernise outdated laws, simplify compliance, and protect workers' rights - while giving legal recognition to India's growing gig workforce for the first time. Several worker-friendly measures - mandatory appointment letters, uniform minimum wages, free annual health check-ups for those over 40, and gender-neutral pay - are welcome steps. Coupled with fewer compliance burdens, stronger social security, and an expanded definition of employees to include gig workers, these reforms could help formalise India's vast informal economy, experts say. The new codes also iron out glaring inconsistencies, such as varied definitions of the same rules that were prevalent in the previous laws, according to Arvind Panagariya, economist at Columbia University and former chairman of the Indian government's think tank Niti Aayog. ""You could not implement 100% of the Indian labour laws without violating 20% of them,"" Prof Panagariya in the Times of India newspaper. But even with the many welcome provisions, two contentious clauses in the reforms have particularly irked unions. These include rules that will make it easier for companies to fire workers and also harder for workers to legally conduct strikes. Earlier, factories with 100 or more workers needed the government's permission before they could lay off employees. Now, that threshold has been increased to 300. ""Why is the government trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce from the labour legislation?"" Sudeep Dutta, national secretary of CITU (Centre for Indian Trade Unions), told the BBC. ""Pending grievance cases for labourers are already in millions. Cases are not being registered… workers are not able to lodge their complaints and now the government is bringing in a labour code which is trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce,"" he added. Mr Dutta also said the new rules which ask workers to give a 14-day notice before going on strike - earlier applicable only to state-run companies - are further snatching away workers' powers to collectively bargain. Economists like Prof Panagariya argue that the old rules barring layoffs in firms with 100 or more workers were ""draconian,"" hampering India's competitiveness compared to countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China. He writes that a flexible labour market is key for India to attract entrepreneurs, as China did decades ago, to bring capital, technology, and global links - catalysts for economic transformation. Nomura economists agree, saying that the increase in worker threshold limit for retrenchment/closure ""should encourage firms to build larger scale factories, boosting the manufacturing sector, and expanding employment opportunities over time"". But economists like Prof Arun Kumar argue that labour restrictions alone do not explain India's weak competitiveness or the slow private-sector investment in new factories. ""Inadequate private investment is not due to these laws but due to inadequate demand, as wages [in India] are low, so mass demand remains low,"" Prof Kumar told the BBC. ""The new labour code will not have any impact on these aspects."" He warns against weakening workers' bargaining power, especially as technology displaces jobs and unemployment remains high. ""It is an issue of retaining the few rights that existed under the old system even though it was highly flawed,"" said Prof Kumar. While ideological differences remain, experts broadly agree that the outdated and complex codes - often used by inspectors to harass factory owners - needed simplification. With over half of India's working-age population out of the labour force and nearly 60% of workers self-employed, it's clear the old rules were failing. The impact of the new rules on India's manufacturing growth and investment remains uncertain, but in the short term, the transition will pose challenges for companies. ""Organisations will need to prepare for changes to wage structures, HR systems, social security provisioning and compliance governance,"" according to staffing agency BDO India. Since labour is regulated by both state and central rules, employers may face dual compliance for a while, says BDO India, even as the government deals with ongoing resistance from unions."
China US,Thailand extradites owner of Myanmar scam city to China,2025-11-12T07:02:44.288Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20xx2pl69o,"She Zhijiang, a Chinese national accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, is being extradited to China - ending his years-long battle against the order. He has been detained in Thailand since 2022, after the Thai police arrested him acting on a Chinese request to Interpol. China accuses She Zhijiang of running illegal online gambling rings, and this week a Thai court upheld the decision to extradite him.  He arrived at a Bangkok airport on Wednesday, flanked by two security officials. His extradition comes ahead of a landmark visit by Thailand's king to Beijing - the first state visit to China by a reigning Thai monarch and a sign of deepening ties. She Zhijiang is one of the biggest names linked to the vast cyberscam hubs in South East Asia, which have trapped thousands of Chinese nationals and sparked a crackdown from Beijing. One of his most notorious projects is Myanmar's Shwe Kokko city, near the Thai border. It's portrayed in promotional videos as a resort city for Chinese tourists, but its glitzy buildings are allegedly home to fraud, money laundering and human trafficking. During a , the BBC saw very few overseas visitors. Local people there said that scam businesses were still operating. She Zhijiang and his company Yatai is sanctioned by the UK and the US for his links to rights abuses in the scam farms in their development. Speaking to the BBC from prison earlier this year, She Zhijiang maintained that his company would ""never accept telecom fraud and scams"" - though he also noted admitted that scammers were likely to enter Shwe Kokko since the city was ""completely open to anyone"". Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, She Zhijiang left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China. In 2014 a Chinese court convicted him of running an illegal lottery. But over the years he expanded his gambling business to Cambodia and other countries in the region. He also holds Cambodian and Myanmar citizenship, according to the US Treasury. The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in scam centres concentrated in South East Asia. They are often lured there by fake job offers and held against their will, forced to defraud others online or face brutal punishment. Many of them are Chinese nationals - a source of concern for Beijing. China has been ramping up crackdowns on such scam operations. In recent months it has ."
China US,"Australia at risk of 'high-impact sabotage' from China, says spy chief",2025-11-12T03:27:44.652Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n43emvejo,"Australia's spy chief says hackers linked to the Chinese government and military are targeting the country's critical infrastructure, warning the country was increasingly at risk of ""high-impact sabotage"". Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), said ""unprecedented levels of espionage"" meant a growing threat of ""cyber-enabled sabotage"" in the next five years. He singled out ""one nation state - no prizes for guessing which one - conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate critical infrastructure in Australia"" and its allies, ""targeting water, transport, telecommunications, and energy networks"". The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment. Authoritarian regimes were now more willing to ""disrupt and destroy,"" Burgess warned. He cited two Chinese hacking groups, Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, and Australia. ""These groups are hackers working for Chinese government intelligence and their military,"" he told business leaders at a forum in Melbourne on Wednesday. ""Both groups were involved in the theft of sensitive information, but the real danger was the threat of sabotage - disruption to critical infrastructure."" He said Salt Typhoon's intent was espionage, breaking into telecommunication networks in the US. ""And they have been probing our telecommunication networks here in Australia too,"" Burgess said. He said Volt Typhoon's actions were intended to be disruptive, with hackers compromising critical infrastructure networks in the US for potential, future sabotage. ""And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well,"" Burgess said. He warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to sabotage critical infrastructure in order to ""impede decision-making, damage the economy, undermine war-fighting capability and sow social discord"". ""I do not think we - and I mean all of us - truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,"" he said. Burgess pointed out that , unrelated to foreign interference, have had significant and widespread impacts on society. ""That's one phone network not working for less than one day,"" he said. ""Imagine the implications if a nation-state took down all the networks? Or turned off the power during a heatwave? Or polluted our drinking water? Or crippled our financial system?"" Spies are increasingly ""broadening their collection requirements"", Burgess said. ""They are aggressively targeting private sector projects, negotiations and investments that might give foreign companies a commercial advantage. And like criminals, they have been aggressively targeting customer data."" The spy chief said conservative estimates showed that espionage cost Australia A$12.5bn ($8.2bn; £6.2bn) in 2023-24, with about $2bn worth of trade secrets and intellectual property stolen from Australian companies in one year. Burgess described the hackers' abilities as ""highly sophisticated, using top-notch tradecraft to find your networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks"". ""And when they have penetrated your networks, they actively and aggressively map your systems, and seek to maintain persistent undetected access that enables them to conduct sabotage at a time and moment of their choosing."""
China US,India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at COP30 climate summit,2025-11-21T01:17:06.411Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v8k8mlego,"At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter. India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being ""worryingly inadequate"". Delhi has argued otherwise. Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming. So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change. The that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement. But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies. UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets. The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it. All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap. But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem. Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December. So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30? Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world. A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that ""global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone"". ""For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,"" he wrote. While , Yadav seemed to expand on this argument. ""Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,"" he said. Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries. The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue. The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn. Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans. Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot. ""The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,"" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30. Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states. India says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline. Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges. Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as "" "". It has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C. Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal. In the , published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU. ""India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,"" a report by the think-tank noted. According to the recent , India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia. But the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan. And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels. It remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends."
China US,Chatham Docks steel firm puts 85 jobs at risk,2025-12-05T10:54:00.531Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gwx1lqdno,"A steel manufacturer based at Chatham Docks has confirmed it is consulting on redundancies for 85 employees. ArcelorMittal Kent Wire, the largest steel manufacturer in Europe, began the process last week ahead of pulling out of the site on Pier Road. The company was among the opponents to now-approved plans to redevelop the docks, claiming they would be forced out of the location should they proceed. A spokesperson from ArcelorMittal Kent Wire said: ""We have informed all employees of the decision to enter a consultation process, with all jobs at the site at risk due to the severity and scale of the challenges facing the business."" The firm has faced difficulties, such as low demand, competition from China, and US tariffs, according to the . Peel Waters, which owns the site, had an application to approved by Medway Council in May 2024. An unsuccessful request to made by then-MP for Rochester and Strood Kelly Tolhurst, meant the Basin 3 proposal was not officially approved until November 2024. The application remains subject to a judicial review, which was heard at the High Court on October 29 and 30. A ruling has not yet been made. ArcelorMittal Kent Wire was one of the businesses opposed to the plan, as was the Save Chatham Docks campaign group. Peel Waters also wants to build a 950-home development on the site, which would include a supermarket and a pub. Ms Tolhurst, who campaigned to save the jobs, said she was ""absolutely devastated for the people at the docks"". ""For some people, it will be life-changing. It's not a booming jobs market at the moment, so for those people it's going to be a really frightening time right on top of Christmas,"" she said. A spokesperson for Peel Waters said: ""For over 10 years, we have tried to work with ArcelorMittal Kent Wire and other tenants to explore relocation solutions, including suggesting suitable local port locations that could meet their operational needs... ""Subject to the outcome of the ongoing judicial review, we remain committed to delivering Basin 3."""
China US,Charity shop finds sold for thousands at auction,2025-11-15T07:26:26.854Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1xqd9j1o,"Two pieces of Chinese porcelain discovered in charity shops have sold for thousands of pounds at auction. The items were taken to Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, whose chairman and Asian art specialist, John Axford, identified them as Chinese works from the 19th Century. A ""five dragon"" dish, which was due to be sold at a Dorset charity shop for £2, went under the hammer for £7,620 and a blue and white ""dragon"" bottle vase sold for £5,080. ""These discoveries highlight the extraordinary treasures that can still be found in the most unexpected places,"" said Mr Axford. An astute manager at the charity shop in Blandford Forum thought it was worth getting the dish valued. Mr Axford said he ""immediately recognised"" the period of the piece, due to its distinctive blue and yellow decoration. Further findings, such as the six-character Emperor Daoguang mark of the period (1821-1850) also confirmed its link to the Chinese Imperial Collection. The proceeds will go directly to the charity of the shop where it was discovered. ""These do not come onto the market very often; they're usually held in public collections or sometimes in private collections and this one has been languishing about somewhere in the south west of England,"" said Mr Axford. ""A lot of quite important Chinese imperial porcelains were brought back to Europe following the fall of the Qing dynasty. ""Almost all of the interest in the sale was from mainland China and Hong Kong,"" he said. The blue and white bottle vase was spotted by an eagle-eyed shopper in a charity shop in Surrey, for which she paid £100. Impressed by its craftsmanship, she brought the piece to Mr Axford, who confirmed that it dated from the first half of the 19th Century. ""Not only are these items culturally and historically significant but in the case of the dish, the sale will directly benefit a good cause,"" he added."
China US,Tesla looks to reset strategy amid sluggish India sales,2025-11-27T07:40:11.867Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrn00pn1m7o,"Tesla has opened its largest sales and service hub in India even as the EV giant struggles with weak sales in Asia's third-largest economy. The centre in the northern city of Gurugram combines an experience showroom, charging, and after-sales services under one roof. The EV maker has sold just over 100 cars in India since its much publicised debut in July this year, dealership data shows. Sources close to the company told the BBC that Tesla is now focusing on strengthening India's EV ecosystem in a bid to revive sales momentum. Tesla didn't directly respond to BBC queries on the low sales figures. The Elon Musk owned EV maker has been struggling to get a foothold in India since its launch in July, receiving bookings for barely over 600 cars till mid-September, according to . Dealership data accessed by the BBC shows only a small portion of these bookings  converted into sales since deliveries started in September, even as competitor models in the premium category, from brands like BMW, BYD and Mercedes Benz reported robust sales aided by festive demand and tax cuts. The EV maker's plan to improve sales is said to include a three-pronged strategy to increase adoption, install more charging stations across the country and boost customer experience. High taxes and slow adoption remain major barriers to EV growth in India, experts say. For Tesla, the steep upfront price of its cars is another challenge. But speaking at the Tesla Centre launch in Gurugram, India head Sharad Agarwal said buyers can recoup up to two million rupees ($22,400; £16,900) over four years on fuel and maintenance - a third of the price of its Model Y sold here. ""Most of the [maintenance] service is done remotely through software updates, which reduces cost of ownership. And cost of home charging is one tenth of petrol prices,""Mr Agarwal said. ""Their [sales] numbers are low by any standard,"" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India told the BBC. ""But I think that's strategic. They have just put their foot in the door in India. And they have good potential to increase sales here in the time to come."" EVs make up less than 3% of passenger vehicle sales in India, and charging infrastructure has been slow to develop -  the country has only Tesla's cars can be charged at home, adding up to 44 miles (70.8km) of range per hour. The company is also expanding its network, including superchargers that can deliver about 170 miles in 15 minutes. Tesla's weak India sales come amid a broader slowdown in demand across its biggest markets -  Europe, China and the US. The company's profits fell in October despite record quarterly revenue, boosted by a last-minute rush from US buyers to claim an expiring tax credit. The firm said revenue for the three months to the end of September hit a record $28bn (£21bn), up 12% from the same time last year. But the company's profits dropped by 37% for the same period, partly due to extra costs linked to tariffs and research and development. In India, Musk has shown in local manufacturing, opting for an import-led strategy despite incentives announced in March last year to attract global EV makers."
China US,"They can't crush our protests, vow Georgians after year of resistance",2025-11-27T00:03:12.454Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c208w378gg7o,"""I'm standing for the future of this country,"" says Giorgi Arabuli, who has taken part in protests on the streets of Georgia's capital Tbilisi almost every night since they began a year ago. Mass demonstrations were met with violent police crackdowns as tens of thousands of Georgians turned out, angered by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's decision on 28 November 2024 to call a four-year halt on moves towards joining the EU. ""I'm from the generation of the 1990s. I've seen those dark times after the civil war,"" said Giorgi. ""Most of it was caused by Russian influence in a post-Soviet country. We don't want to go back there."" Since then Georgians have seen a ""dismantling of democracy"", , and it has prompted accusations of Russian-style rule. On the streets, the protests have evolved into a grinding war of attrition. For months, Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue was blocked for a few hours every evening. New laws and a heavy police presence forced the protesters to adapt, marching through adjacent streets and facing nightly arrests. The Georgian Dream government has imposed massive fines for blocking roads, slapped criminal charges on young protesters and most recently pushed through a law allowing up to 14 days' imprisonment for a first offence of blocking traffic, with repeat offenders facing up to a year in jail. ""Freedom for regime prisoners,"" reads a large banner carried towards the nearby Supreme Court. ""They've used every method to crush the protests... but the fact is they haven't been able to,"" says Nata Koridze. Her husband, Zura Japaridze, is one of six key opposition figures jailed after refusing to testify before a parliamentary commission into alleged crimes by the previous government. The six were jailed for up to eight months and banned from holding public office for two years. Prosecutors have since announced new charges against eight opposition leaders, including Japaridze. They now face up to 15 years for alleged sabotage and aiding foreign powers. Nata Koridze's husband is due to be released on 22 December but she says he is due to appear in court again three days later. They are accused of communicating with Western partners about government abuses - standard democratic practice - as evidence of betraying state interests. Japaridze, like all the jailed politicians, is held in solitary confinement. ""Zura has not seen anybody except for a doctor and the guard,"" she says. Georgia's path to EU membership, once the cornerstone of its post-Soviet identity, is now farther away than ever. Earlier this month, the EU's annual enlargement report delivered what , concluding it was now considered an EU candidate ""in name only"". ""Georgia is not on the trajectory to become an EU member state, neither in 2030 nor later,"" said Pawel Herczynski, rejecting the government's pledge to ensure membership by 2030. The BBC approached the head of the parliamentary committee on European integration and other Georgian Dream MPs for comment, but no-one was available. The government's public response has been increasingly hostile towards its foreign critics. Parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili has accused the EU of ""ideological and political dictates"", telling pro-government TV this month that ""today's Brussels does not want a Georgia that is like us"". ""They want a country standing on one foot,"" he complained. ""The policies and approaches in Brussels must be changed. For them, the Georgian people and their choice mean nothing, zero."" Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, won 54% of the vote in last year's disputed parliamentary elections, which monitors from Europe's OSCE security mission said were marked by several shortcomings, including intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, especially public sector employees. All opposition parties have since boycotted parliament leaving it entirely in government hands. That means increasingly repressive legislation has been passed unopposed. As well as steep fines for protesters blocking the road, there have been a restrictive broadcasting law and a law on foreign grants requiring all foreign funding for civil society and media to be approved by a government commission. Hundreds of protesters have been fined and dozens jailed, among them well-known actor Andro Chichinadze, given two years for allegedly organising protests. His theatre - once the best attended in Tbilisi - has closed in solidarity. The belief that Georgia's government is acting in Russia's interest is widespread among pro-Europeans here. They point to the ruling party's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s; legislation mirroring Russian laws targeting civil society; the government's refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine and increasingly hostile anti-Western rhetoric. Georgia's leaders reject that portrayal, describing their approach towards Russia as ""pragmatic"" and their primary duty to maintain peace with their northern neighbour. ""Where are the facts?"" said Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, denying pro-Russian bias during a recent TV interview. The government, he said, was being ""responsible to Georgian society which wants to keep peace in the country"". That is not the view of one of Georgia's most respected journalists, Mzia Amaglobeli, imprisoned for two years for slapping a police officer. ""Russia is conquering us without war. An oligarch is ruling our country, depriving us of a European future and legitimising autocratic, dictatorial rule. We need the support of the democratic world,"" she told the BBC in a handwritten letter from prison. for Freedom of Thought next month, says she has lost the sight of one eye and her remaining vision is worsening in solitary confinement: ""I have difficulty reading for even 10-15 minutes at a time."" Georgia's democratic decline intensified even before last year's elections, with a June 2024 Russian-style law on foreign influence that targeted civil society and independent media. Students played a big part in protests at the time and the government has responded with sweeping education reforms planned next February. Georgia's 19 state universities will be required to concentrate on a single academic discipline under the slogan ""one city, one faculty"". The reforms will tackle perceived problems including excessive concentration of universities in Tbilisi, duplication of programmes and inadequate state funding. The prime minister argues that funding should be ""focused on fulfilling state tasks"". Leading figures at Georgia's pre-eminent research institution, Ilia State University, say the reform is more about imposing political control and eradicating free space. ""After political parties, media and NGOs, universities must be put under pressure,"" says Nina Doborjginidze, rector of Ilia State University. ""If students are removed from the capital, they're removed from the political scene."" ""This is not about education quality, it's a political project,"" adds vice-rector Georgi Gvalia. ""This is an abrupt change in Georgia's foreign policy from being one of the most pro-European countries in the region to the most difficult partners of the West, and change towards more autocratic great powers, like Russia and especially China."" Georgia and China now have a strategic partnership and Beijing has invested heavily in Georgian infrastructure. Back on Rustaveli Avenue, teacher Rusudan Lomidze, who has attended the protests every day, says Georgia's fate is inextricably linked to Ukraine's. ""If Ukraine is forced to sign a capitulation agreement, it will be an absolute disaster for us. Our boys are fighting in Ukraine, and they are fighting for both Ukraine and Georgia."" More than 110 Georgian volunteers have been killed fighting for Ukraine, both Georgian citizens and ethnic Georgians, and the Georgian Legion is the biggest contingent of foreign fighters there. The crowds in Tbilisi are smaller than they were a year ago, but several hundred protesters still gather every night despite the risks. Reflecting on her years as a diplomat working towards EU and Nato integration, Nata Koridze now believes ""all of that has crumbled"". ""But the protest embodies an idea. And ideas live through decades, through centuries."""
China US,Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash,2025-11-11T15:44:10.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko,"A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales  told Qian Zhimin she was ""the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed"". After fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures. More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. Investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul. ""If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,"" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. ""Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost."" Qian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after . She moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend. So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property. As Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could ""get rich while lying down"". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping. But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke. Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022. In the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth. Police raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices. But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme. ""The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,"" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC. One of her investo s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day. ""That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,"" he says. He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more. In addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them. ""There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment."" Investors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found. A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends. Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: ""We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance."" The company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready. Lantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly. ""Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,"" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. ""They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world."" A range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said. ""We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?"" The company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to. ""That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,"" Mr Yu says. Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog. But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li. ""Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,"" he remembers. ""We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth. ""She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations."" Mr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them. A Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme. ""The payouts suddenly stopped,"" Mr Yu recalls. ""The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough."" What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police. What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money. Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project. When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told. At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. Qian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a ""Bitcoin pioneer"", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she ""never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her"". Before her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a ""glimpse of sunlight"". The cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a that will start in earnest early next year. There are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain. It is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value. As in other ""proceeds of crime"" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond. Separately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage. The toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC. Still, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine. Mr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said. ""She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst."" Mr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines: ""Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice."""
China US,Two popular gay dating platforms removed from Apple app store in China,2025-11-12T02:55:23.056Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98n2kye01eo,"Apple has confirmed that it has removed two of China's most popular gay dating apps  - Blued and Finka - from its app store in the country following an order from authorities. ""We follow the laws of the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,"" an Apple spokesperson said. The move has raised concerns amongst the LGBT community in the country. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy in Washington and the companies behind both apps for comment. A ""lite"" version of the Blued app remains available on Chinese app stores, according to checks by the BBC. Some other gay and bisexual dating apps are also still available in the country, like Jicco and Jack'd. Blued is one of the most widely-used gay dating apps in China, with tens of millions of downloads. Apple runs a separate app store in China, in accordance with the country's strict internet laws. Popular apps like Instagram and WhatsApp are not available in China. Android device users there use locally adapted versions of the operating system as the Google Play Store is also blocked in China. Members of the LGBT community expressed concerns about the removal of Blued and Finka, with one saying, ""I hope those heterosexual policymakers can understand that love is rare - it's not something shameful or unspeakable."" In 2022, popular US-based gay dating app Grindr was removed from Apple's App Store in China shortly after the Cyberspace Administration of China began a crackdown on content it viewed as illegal and inappropriate. The following year, the Chinese government announced new rules requiring all apps serving domestic users to register for licenses, resulting in a slew of foreign apps being removed online. The online regulator said the rules were designed to ""promote the standardised and healthy development of the internet industry."" Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, though same-sex marriages remain unrecognised. Advocacy groups, including the Beijing LGBT Center and the ShanghaiPride, have ceased operations in China in recent years."

In total, £2,493,703 from the Office for Students will go to the University of Worcester, which has become the third time in a row the educator has been successful in gaining such funding. According to the university, the £10.5m secured across the three rounds will benefit nearly 3,000 students. Vice chancellor and chief executive, Professor David Green, said: ""This recognition reflects the university's long and successful history of educating highly employable graduates."" The funding will enable the university to create new high-tech digitally enabled simulation rooms, including a specialist midwifery simulation suite. It will also see the purchase of a decommissioned ambulance for training paramedics. Two more highly sophisticated Anatomage tables are also set to be purchased, which show the students life-size 3D digital scans of real people who donated their bodies for science. By increasing its simulation capacity, the university said it would be able to educate even more health professionals for the future. Simon Trickett, chief executive of NHS Herefordshire and Worcestershire, said: ""This is extremely positive news for our local health and care system. ""The University of Worcester already plays a vital role in developing the highly skilled and compassionate health professionals our communities rely on, and this latest funding award will further strengthen that pipeline."""

China US,Fracking has transformed an Argentine town but what about the nation?,2025-11-27T00:02:47.835Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewj1e1yk2vo,"Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time. When his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires. There was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off. Then in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed. ""We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre,"" says Mr Jiménez. ""Then the town grew and passed us by."" Fuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo's population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022, In addition to these people who are already permanently settled in Añelo, there are some 15,000 industry workers who sleep in the city every night. This has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through. Last year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres. Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed. Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface. The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron. By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas. This accounts ""for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production"", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official. He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to. Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. ""We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,"" he says. ""All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta."" The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency. ""Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],"" says Mr Gadano. ""This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices."" Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports ""is very important"" for the country, ""especially when two or three years ago we were in the red"". Yet he adds that it won't be ""the panacea"" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt. ""I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,"" he says. ""However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind."" Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors. They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank. ""Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',"" explains Mr Gadano. ""That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players."" The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted. Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection. Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government ""is doing what it has to do and what it can do"". What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. ""All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,"" notes Mr Gadano. This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns. ""We are really losing in the public debate,"" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. ""There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic."" Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. ""When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day."" Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. ""Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs."""
China US,Two meals for $1: Why China's youth are not spending,2025-11-11T23:12:23.111Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pvlvdve7o,"China is facing a number of economic challenges and its government wants the next generation of consumers to start spending more for the good of all, but it is not having much luck convincing them to do so. Officials say insufficient domestic consumption across much of society is dragging on growth, but recent graduates have more reasons than most to be cautious. Youth unemployment has been hovering at just under 20% for some time, those who have jobs fear they could lose them, and the ongoing property crisis can make the prospect of home ownership seem unreachable, especially in big cities. This uncertainty is encouraging many of China's youth to instead embrace frugality, and social media has been flooded with tips on how people can survive on small amounts of money. ""My work is dedicated to a minimalist way of life,"" one full-time influencer tells the BBC. Videos by the 24-year-old, who goes by the online name Zhang Small Grain of Rice, feature content like her using a bar of ordinary soap for all her personal cleaning requirements, rather than expensive skin cleansing products. She can also be seen walking around shopping areas and showing off various bags and items of clothing which she says are good value because they'll last longer. Companies pay her to feature their goods to her 97,000 followers on the Xiaohongshu site. ""I hope more people will understand consumption traps so they can save. This will reduce their stress and relax them,"" she said. Others focus on budget eating. A 29-year-old using the name Little Grass Floating In Beijing posts videos of himself preparing basic dishes. He says he can have two meals for a little over $1 (76p). ""I am just an ordinary person from the countryside. I have neither a good educational background nor a network of influential contacts, so I must work hard for a better life"", he tells his followers. He works for an online sales firm and claims his extremely modest lifestyle has enabled him to save more than $180,000 over 6 years. Some have asked him online if he would expect his future wife and children to live the same way and what the end goal is. His response: ""I don't know"". China has developed a reputation for being an unstoppable economy, able to ride out the turmoil of the pandemic and US President Donald Trump's trade war. But analysts say it will face significant long-term challenges if it does not boost domestic spending. While the US has a problem with people racking up credit card debt, in China it's the opposite challenge. People are already inclined to save rather than spend and this only increases when there are perceptions of tough times ahead. The Chinese government has been promising for years to increase household consumption but it still accounts for only around 39% of gross domestic product (GDP), as opposed to about 60% in most developed countries. Part of the problem is that today's youth are more pessimistic than in the 1990s and early 2000s. ""Right now, making money is more important to me. I actually need to expand my income sources and cut my costs,"" a young woman in central Beijing tells the BBC. Like many other young people, her salary has been cut, she adds. ""I changed jobs, and it doesn't pay as well. Also, I don't know for how long this new job can sustain me in the future. A bad economic environment like this makes people feel down because we're not earning very much. Finding a job in the first place also isn't easy."" This level of youth unemployment - apart from spreading insecurity - makes it easier for struggling employers to cut wages because workers face a choice of accepting lower pay or diving into a highly competitive job market. A young man, also in his 20s, says there are low-level jobs available but it's hard to find decent work in one's area of expertise. ""Some of my friends are unemployed, still living at home and looking for a job,"" he says. ""They had all kinds of majors at university from financial services to product sales. The economy is a bit off right now. I hope it gets better so we can all have a better life"". And how does he rate the chances of this happening soon? ""I'm not very optimistic,"" he admits. A big concern for China's recent graduates is that the country is making a difficult transition from being a mass producer of cheap goods to a high-tech economy.  And many of these new industries don't require as many workers. Economist George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University,  has been tracking this phenomenon. He cites figures from two big recruitment firms in Beijing showing a high level of university graduates, even with master's degrees, taking jobs as delivery drivers. ""It reflects the skills mismatch between the qualifications which people are leaving higher education with and what's out there in terms of demand for labour,"" he says. ""Of course, that's not being helped by the push to become a champion in robotics and AI because, at least for the time being, this is something of a dampener on job opportunities. Tech isn't really that labour intensive."" Helena Lofgren has been studying China's consumption patterns for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs and believes its economy is relying too heavily on pouring money into preferred industries and focusing on selling products overseas in a time of considerable geopolitical uncertainty. ""People save more than they consume, and you need consumption to make up a bigger share of the economy than it's doing today in China,"" she says. ""You have a very export-oriented and investment driven economy and what we see now is that these parts are too big for the economy to stay healthy."" It is all about economic imbalance. If, for example, China suddenly lost significant export revenue would it have the tools to counter this by financially empowering its enormous domestic population? Some observers have questioned how serious the Communist Party is about increasing domestic consumption. In recent decades, the country has thrived on an investment and export model but that approach is now facing a big challenge: deflation. Would-be customers are often waiting for the price of goods to fall. If a young couple wanted to buy, say, a new lounge suite, it may make sense for them to wait to get a better deal. The longer they, and many more like them, hold off from making big purchases, the more likely companies are to cut prices, leading people to wait even longer for an even better deal. It may seem like a good idea to have cheaper goods, but deflation can force firms out of business and drag on growth overall. This could be countered by somehow fuelling optimism amongst 20 or 30-something consumers. Building a better social safety net or increasing minimum wages might help. There have been some attempts to do this by offering incentives to replace old cars, home appliances and other items but it has not significantly lifted consumption. The influencer Zhang says being cautious with spending runs deep in her country's culture. ""My grandfather's generation was very frugal, very thrifty. It is part of Chinese tradition. For Chinese people to be economical is in their bones,"" she says."
China US,WHO warning over shortage of obesity jabs ,2025-12-01T14:05:41.506Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8n0753zzo,"Fewer than one in 10 people who could benefit from obesity jabs like Wegovy are able to get them, warns the as it releases its first guidance on the drugs. With more than one billion people worldwide now obese, it is calling for more widespread and fairer access to GLP-1 medication. According to projections, more than two billion will be obese by 2030 unless action is taken. High costs, limited production capacity, and supply-chain constraints are major barriers to universal access to the injections that can help people shift significant weight, says WHO. It has already added them to its (for overweight patients with diabetes) that countries are advised to provide. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Our new guidance recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care. ""While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms."" WHO says these drugs, sometime called skinny jabs, represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity, from a ""lifestyle condition"" to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease. It says the drugs can be taken long-term -  for six months or more - but must be prescribed along with advice on diet and exercise, so that people can keep the weight off. Too few people around the world can access them, says WHO. ""Our greatest concern is equitable access,"" said Tedros. Even under the current best projected scenario, the production of GLP-1 therapies could only cover around 100 million people - less than 10% of those who need them, according to the WHO. The guideline calls on countries and companies to expand access, through strategies such as voluntary licensing - where a pharmaceutical company grants permission for others to make affordable non-brand versions of its patented drug. A patent on semaglutide - the core ingredient of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy - is due to expire in several countries in 2026, meaning other drug-makers will soon be free to produce and sell cheap versions in places like India, Canada, China, Brazil and Turkey. WHO says countries must also create healthier environments to promote good health and prevent obesity. GLP-1 drugs mimick a natural hormone to slow digestion, curb appetite and increase feelings of fullness so people eat less. In the UK, the injections are prescription only medicines, which means they can only be prescribed by a healthcare professional for a person who clinically needs it. Some are available on the NHS, but more are sold privately. There is a black market and to be safe people should avoid buying from unregulated sellers such as beauty salons or via social media. People typically start to lose weight within a few weeks of starting on the weekly injections. Research suggests people may within a year of stopping the medication though, as their normal food cravings return. Being overweight or obese increases your risk for developing health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Obesity affects people in every country and was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024, according to the WHO."
China US,'It was part of my childhood' - keeping Ulster Scots heritage alive,2025-11-30T06:14:24.371Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1kpzr152o,"For Gillian Rea, speaking Ulster Scots was a normal part of her childhood and she wants to see others enjoying the culture. A newly-minted tour guide, she has turned her dream into a reality sharing her Ulster Scots heritage with those who wish to learn the history and customs. ""People travel more now, and visit other countries,"" Gillian said. ""But sometimes we don't know what's on our doorstep. ""I think it's really important to explore the culture around you, to know who you are and where you come from in order to see where you're going."" The term Ulster Scots refers to people who migrated from the Lowlands of Scotland to Ulster in the 17th century. Now, it can refer to their heritage and cultural traditions including language, music, and dance. Gillian, who is from Kilwaughter in County Antrim, was one of several people to share readings and stories at an event in Cullybackey as part of Ulster Scots Leid (language) week. Much of Ulster Scots poetry is centred around the home, work, rural living and connection to the land. This event celebrated the weaver poets, also known as the Rhyming Weavers, who wrote in 18th and 19th century Ulster, inspired by the booming linen industry. They earned this name through their style of verse that, when read aloud, sounds like the rhythm a loom makes. An Ulster Scot historian and writer, Dr David Hume, was also at the Cullybackey event. ""At this time Ulster Scots was under pressure and these people were writing bilingually in both English and Ulster Scots,"" he said. Centuries later, Gillian said Ulster Scots is facing a new raft of challenges. ""It's important to keep that language alive, particularly in the world of technology and social media where everything is becoming very much generic with how people speak. ""There's Americanisms coming in, influenced obviously from film, TV and media. ""To counterbalance that, we've got to have more celebrations of the Ulster Scots language. ""We have to keep it alive and rich by passing on these stories."" Similar to Gillian, Davy Moore also grew up in a home where Ulster Scots was part of everyday life. ""There were five of us living in the house with my mum and dad, granny and granda,"" he said. ""We spoke this way all the time. I went to a local primary school, farmer sons and daughters went there and they also spoke like that. ""The teacher didn't correct us, she let us tear away."" It wasn't until grammar school where he felt a changing attitude towards how he spoke. ""People who didn't speak this dialect or language, they would sometimes look down on it as if you were not intelligent, or you were like a redneck."" After taking a creative writing course, Davy has since published his own novel and a collection of short stories. He hopes to one day put together his own modern book of Ulster Scots poetry, in the hope that when he's gone, a younger generation may pick it up. ""I'm not saying for one minute I'm anything like the weaver poets,"" Davy joked Those who attended the Cullybackey event discussed fond memories of growing up and hearing some words and phrases that are now very rarely used. ""Instead of fed up, you'd say I'm scundered with this weather,"" Gillian said. ""If it's cold, you would say I'm foundered."" Another is the phrase ""read up"" (pronounced like red up) which means to tidy up or clean up. Davy added the use of the word ""tovi"", which means to boast. He also enjoyed talking about the use of the word ""thran"" (stubborn or difficult) - something he joked is a common trait of Northern Irish people."
China US,Machu Picchu hit by a row over tourist buses,2025-11-24T00:06:53.799Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g8wrd61zo,"Machu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated. Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes. It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk. He admits that in the past few months ""there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here"". This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport. To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg. Back in September, local protestors angry at what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process to replace Consettur blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks. This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services. A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian. Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start. It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly. ""The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,"" he says. ""This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners."" These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur. Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province. As the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class. Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: ""We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train."" Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site ""was a nightmare for us"". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57. The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally. ""Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages."" He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment. Outside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that ""more needs to be done for the local communities"". She adds: ""We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition."" Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru. ""We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,"" he says. ""If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term."" He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather. ""[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,"" says Mr Gonzalez. ""And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion."" But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years. ""I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to."" Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Torontoy run buses to and from Machu Picchu. ""If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them."""

He believes the stigma of secondhand is going: ""You've got various websites online where you can buy repurposed items, clothing, etc. I think reuse is on the up. ""Cost of living crisis is extreme at the moment so people don't necessarily have the money to spend on new items for Christmas. ""We are an alternative to that. We are an alternative to the consuming on Black Friday."" There are often Black Friday deals on appliances, but Mr Thompson explained that when they get second hand ones in to clean and refurbish, there is usually very little wrong with them, or can be quickly fixed. He explained that while recycling some items can be a good way to go, the process still produces emissions, so ""by reusing things you're generating far less carbon"". Of the 18,000 goods passed on last year by KFR, more than 7,000 were furniture and nearly 3,800 were electrical. Jen Gale, from Warminster, Wiltshire, runs a blog and podcast called Sustainable(ish) - she and her family have previously done a year of buying nothing new. She said that Black Friday can be useful if someone has a ""specific item in mind, Black Friday can be a real helping hand in terms of some financial savings"". ""I guess it becomes problematic when it's really just encouraging us to consume and to buy things that we didn't know we wanted, we don't necessarily need, and just really, encouraging that very sort of mindless and thoughtless consumption,"" she said. KFR has found itself expanding in a few ways: earlier this year it teamed up with another charity to offer house clearances. It has an arrangement with household recycling centres in Wiltshire and has opened a new location in Swindon too. It is also used by the local councils to provide furniture and appliances for those in need through the household support fund - last year this helped nearly 700 households."
China US,More than 100 Aston Martin jobs 'at risk' in St Athan  ,2025-11-07T19:10:05.727Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c874wxdgqv3o,"More than 100 jobs are at risk at the Aston Martin St Athan plant in the Vale of Glamorgan, BBC Wales has been told. The company has blamed losses on US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and weak demand from China. Aston Martin, which started production in south Wales in 2019, said its proposals remain under consultation but no final figures on jobs have been confirmed. The Unite union described the situation as ""devastating"" and said it would begin a consultation with the company to mitigate redundancies. in response to continued challenges in the global macro-economic environment. It said the actions it was taking ""may affect contractor, fixed-term and permanent roles"". Staff production jobs make up the majority of roles being consulted on as well as a number of contractor positions, BBC Wales was told. Andrew Pearson, Unite regional officer, said the news was ""devastating"" for the workforce at Aston Martin. Aston Martin has seen its shares tumble during the year and last month said it faced losing £110m due to the ""global macroeconomic environment"". The Welsh government said it is in contact with Aston Martin and is prepared to to work with the company to offer support to workers following the outcome of the consultation. The current round of potential job cuts follow a decision by the company to cut 170 jobs at St Athan in February."
China US,The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis,2025-11-21T08:03:37.342Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkgxeeyzno,"""Everyone comes in here, it's very cheap. I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries,"" says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. ""It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?"" The store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis. Instead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street. More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid ""challenging trading conditions"". It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year. Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales. These places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops. So why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time? One thing is clear - we're not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed. ""[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops,"" says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. ""[They're doing this] by saying, 'These are things I'm going to buy from you.' ""They know their prices inside out."" Sometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices. But that's not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition. All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers. For pound shops in particular, it's even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn't what it used to be. After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today. Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago. In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above. ""We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,"" he says. ""What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous."" But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right. His Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries. ""We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they're going to buy it,"" he declares. As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers. ""We've got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices,"" he says. So, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of ""extra margin"". If you don't get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel. The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later. ""They just didn't understand the discount business,"" he argues. ""They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it."" Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs. Poundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making. The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. Its owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn't popular with shoppers. ""Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth. But she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan. This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead. The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then. Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents. And shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains. Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes. By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car. But budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis. Not only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of ""extreme discounting"" online to contend with. Today, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There's also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers. ""AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it's growing,"" says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel. Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period. Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul. ""If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you'd find on Temu etc, so if Amazon's doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it's notable,"" says Mr Carroll. ""There's a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come."" There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock. ""As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that,"" she says. ""It's not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody."" The danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market. All this coupled with a ""cost-of-business crisis"" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth. ""You've got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you're at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it's super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there's so many people in that market. ""But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out."" It's not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently. The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too. Savers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland's Peckham store space. OneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs. ""Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing."" As for current trading, he says, he is getting by. ""We're not saying we're earning fortunes of money. We're not - but we're paying our way, and we're just waiting for better times."" His focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading. ""It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas,"" he says. Catherine Shuttleworth reckons that's where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. ""They're a great place to go and deck your house out."" But also, they may be the only place many households can afford to shop. Not everyone likes to shop online, or wants to make the trip to a retail park. ""For some people, budget shopping is a hobby,"" she adds, ""but for others it's an absolute necessity."""
China US,What was agreed on climate change at COP30 in Brazil?,2025-11-22T21:34:13.368Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gqez4lkyo,"Countries have reached a new deal to tackle climate change at the annual UN meeting in Belém, Brazil. But , with no new measures on fossil fuels or deforestation. COP30 was the 30th annual UN climate meeting. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"". ""Parties"" refers to the nearly 200 countries that have signed up to the original UN climate agreement of 1992. COP30 was due to run from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. But the talks overran into Saturday 22 November. World leaders gathered on Thursday 6 and Friday 7 November, before the conference began. The host nation is chosen by participating countries after a nomination from the host region. The conference was held in Brazil for the first time. The choice of Belém, on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, caused significant challenges. Some delegations struggled to book affordable accommodation, leading to concerns that poorer nations could be priced out. The decision to to build a road for the summit also proved controversial. Brazil also continued to grant which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were among those to attend the leaders' summit. UN secretary general António Guterres and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also there. The Prince of Wales, attending on behalf of King Charles, gave a speech calling for countries to come together to tackle the ""fast-approaching"" threats of future climate change. But many leaders were absent, including China's President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. China and the US are the two biggest emitters of planet-warming gases. Delegations from more than 190 countries, including a large number from China, attended the talks, however. The US government did not send any national officials, although some local and state leaders did attend. Politicians and diplomats were joined by scientists, campaigners and journalists. Previous summits have been criticised for the large number of attendees who are connected to the coal, oil and gas industries. Campaigners argue this shows . COP30 took place at a time when global climate targets were under significant strain. In Paris in 2015, nearly 200 countries to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels and to keep them ""well below"" 2C. There is very strong scientific evidence that the impacts of climate change - from extreme heat to sea-level rise - would be far greater at 2C than at 1.5C. But while the use of renewable energy - particularly solar power - is , countries' climate plans have fallen short of what the 1.5C goal requires. Ahead of COP30, countries were supposed to have submitted updated plans detailing how they would cut their emissions of planet-warming gases. However, had done so by the end of October. UN secretary general António Guterres warned that ""overshooting"" 1.5C is inevitable, given how close the target is and how high emissions remain. But he said he hoped temperatures could still be brought back down to the target by the end of the century. Brazil hoped to agree steps to deliver commitments made at previous COPs. At COP28, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2023, about the need to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"". Brazil wanted the talks to secure clearer steps for how countries would achieve this. The idea of such a ""roadmap"" had been backed by dozens of countries, including the UK, but was strongly opposed by others, including those reliant on fossil fuels. In the end, the deal mentioned that existing UAE agreement - but did not strengthen the language around moving away from fossil fuels. Brazil announced its own plan to launch a fossil fuel ""roadmap"" which countries could sign up to - but it sits outside the main deal. At COP29, richer countries committed to give developing nations to help them tackle climate change. But that is far less than poorer countries say they need. That agreement also included an aspiration to raise this to $1.3tn from public and private sources. Ahead of COP30, Brazil published a ""roadmap"" detailing how the $1.3tn goal could be achieved. The COP30 deal called for a trebling of money to help the worst affected nations to adapt to the impacts of climate change, by 2035. But it's not clear how much will come from public versus private sources. And richer nations have consistently undelivered on their cash promises. At the leaders' summit ahead of COP30, Brazil launched the ""Tropical Forests Forever Facility"" - a fund which hopes to raise $125bn (£96bn) from loans and investments. The aim is to try to prevent the loss of tropical forests by rewarding countries who keep their forests standing. But the UK said it would not be committing public money - though could do so in the future and would encourage the private sector to invest. Brazil announced plans to launch a roadmap outlining steps to meet the pledge to halt and reverse deforestation, which was made in COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. But, like fossil fuels, this deforestation roadmap did not make it into the final deal. UN climate talks rely on consensus - all countries present have to agree in order to pass a deal. That can be challenging. Different nations have competing priorities, based for example on their dependence on fossil fuels, economic position or vulnerability to climate change. The backdrop for the talks this year was dominated by the fracturing consensus on tackling climate change, not least from the Trump administration. The US President has pledged to , and roll back green initiatives put in place by his predecessors. Some observers, such as campaigner Greta Thunberg, have accused previous COPs of ""greenwashing"" - letting countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without actually making the changes needed. Significant global agreements have been reached at previous COP sessions, allowing greater progress than national measures on their own. Despite the difficulties of delivering the 1.5C warming limit, the commitment - agreed at COP21 in Paris - has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN. This has helped bring down the level of anticipated warming - even though the world is still not acting at the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals. But the view from many scientists and observers is that the agreements made at COP30 are unlikely to shift the dial much on climate change. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

China US,Teen builds advanced robotic hand from Lego,2025-11-26T06:13:34.165Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g1001z95o,"A teenager has designed and built a fully working robotic hand out of Lego pieces. Jared Lepora, 16, from Bristol, spent about two years on the creation, assisted by his father Nathan who is a professor in robotics at the University of Bristol. ""My dad specialises in making advanced robot hands and I thought these principles were always really cool, so why not make it out of Lego?” Jared said. Nathan hopes the Lego hand, which can pick up variety of objects including fruits and cups, could one day become a ""proper Lego set for other children"" to build. The hand, which is driven by two motors using tendons, has four fingers, each functioning with three joints. Using Lego clutch gears, the mechanics of the fingers move together until they touch an object then stop moving, similar to a human hand. After building the hand and jointly writing an academic paper on it with his father, Jared was invited to give a speech at the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025 conference in Hangzhou, China, and was the youngest speaker there. Nathan said he used to take his son into the lab during summer holidays, where he got familiar with 3D-printed designs while chatting with PhD students. ""And he had the idea of making one out of Lego...maybe he'll become my boss someday,"" he said. ""This genuinely could be of interest to other children to engage with advanced robotics, it's a way in for them. ""If anyone can build the hand, and maybe other children can make design changes, then that's really exciting. ""Wouldn't it be amazing if it could be a proper Lego set for other children, that would be exciting,"" he added."

China US,E-commerce platform breach exposes nearly 34 million customers' data,2025-12-01T04:08:47.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36zwywll02o,"South Korea's largest online retailer, Coupang, has apologised for a massive data breach potentially involving nearly 34 million local customer accounts. The country's internet authority said that it is investigating the breach and that details from the millions of accounts have likely been exposed. The e-commerce platform is often described as South Korea's equivalent of Amazon.com. The breach marks the latest in a series of data leaks at major firms in the country, including its telecommunications giant, SK Telecom. Coupang told the BBC it became aware of the unauthorised access of personal data of about 4,500 customer accounts on 18 November and immediately reported it to the authorities. But later checks found that some 33.7 million customer accounts - all in South Korea - were likely exposed, said Coupang, adding that the breach is believed to have begun as early as June through a server based overseas. The exposed data is limited to name, email address, phone number, shipping address and some order histories, Coupang said. No credit card information or login credentials were leaked. Those details remain securely protected and no action is required from Coupang users at this point, the firm added. The number of accounts affected by the incident represents more than half of South Korea's roughly-52 million population. Coupang, which is founded in South Korea and headquartered in the US, said recently that it had nearly 25 million active users. Coupang apologised to its customers and warned them to stay alert to scams impersonating the company. The firm did not give details on who is behind the breach. South Korean media outlets reported on Sunday that a former Coupang employee from China was suspected of being behind the breach. The authorities are assessing the scale of the breach as well as whether Coupang had broken any data protection safety rules, South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT said in a statement. ""As the breach involves the contact details and addresses of a large number of citizens, the Commission plans to conduct a swift investigation and impose strict sanctions if it finds a violation of the duty to implement safety measures under the Protection Act."" Coupang has faced multiple cyber-security breaches in recent years, including one incident that exposed 460,000 customers' data. Major South Korean organisations have delivered harsh criticism over the latest breach. The editorial board of local newspaper Chosun Ilbo described the incident as ""preposterous"" and called for strong sanctions on firms responsible for leaks of its customer data. Another local media outlet, the Dong-A Ilbo, said the breach is ""the worst personal data leak"" in Korean history. The media outlet questioned how long the incident went unnoticed, adding that it ""means their internal data protection system barely mattered."" The breach marks the latest in a series of cyber-security incidents affecting major South Korean companies this year, despite the country's reputation for stringent data privacy rules. SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile operator, was fined nearly $100m (£76m) over a data breach involving more than 20 million subscribers. In September, Lotte Card also said the data of nearly three million customers was leaked after a cyber-attack on the credit card firm."
China US,Couple's secret to 73-year marriage,2025-12-07T06:57:29.737Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgkvr7d7gdo,"A couple who have been married for 73 years say they have never seriously fallen out. Bill and Olive Miles mark each anniversary by returning to Guildford Cathedral, where they wed on 15 November 1952. The pair, now 95 and 93, met at a youth club when Olive was 16 and Bill was a couple of years older. ""I went with one boyfriend and obviously came back with another one... and I've still got the same one,"" Mrs Miles said. The couple married in front of 132 people when Mrs Miles was almost 20 and Mr Miles nearly 22, having completed his national service. She said in 1952, the ""shell"" of the cathedral was there but it is not the site seen today. It is a building that holds a lot of significance for the couple. Mrs Miles, who was born in Canada, describes Guildford Cathedral as her ""mother home"". ""I was brought up there, I was the first to be confirmed there, and it's just always been my church, it doesn't matter where else I've been,"" she said. In more than seven decades together the couple have travelled extensively, particularly after retiring, to countries including Canada, America, China, India, Nepal, Russia. Mrs Miles says they were also handy on the dance floor. ""We were reasonable dancers,"" she said. ""We did amateur dancing, and we used to go to the Butlins dancing competitions in Brighton quite often, and we maintained our dancing right up until the 60th anniversary."" The couple renewed their vows after 25 and 50 years married, and hold a reception each year to mark the occasion. These events, Mrs Miles explains, have grown smaller. ""As you get to 60 years, to 70 years, because in actual fact, when we look now at the wedding pictures of 132 guests, we are the only two left that are alive."" Their lengthy union has stood the test of time, and while there have been difficulties to manage, the Miles' remain united.

Mila Stanzani, from Trowbridge, told the BBC that getting her first podium finish at the championships in China last month was ""incredible and very surreal"". The sport of obstacle course racing is set to replace the fifth event in the modern pentathlon - which is currently equestrian - at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. But Stanzani hopes it will become a stand alone Olympic event in the future. The 27 year-old took bronze at the inaugural UIPM 2025 Obstacle World Championships held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing. Stanzani competed in the 100m sprint race held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing, which saw athletes race across a course made up of 11 different obstacles similar to what you would see on a Ninja Warrior track. On BBC Wiltshire's Sport at Six show, she said it is ""very thrilling, it's like a puzzle you need to try and solve it, but be fast as well"". Obstacle course racing (OCR) athletes need ""incredible grip strength, precision, accuracy"" according to Stanzani as well as ""a bit of confidence"". She was introduced to the sport when she was 19 years-old and hopes to become an Olympian if the sport does become its own discipline in the future. She is currently the fastest female in the sport in the UK, and said she will ""keep eating my rice and peas and just hope for the best""."
China US,"Shoppers loved the 'fabric queen'. Then, order by order, her story fell apart",2025-12-05T19:02:48.772Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y937w7xl7o,"At 6ft tall and plus-size, shop-bought clothes had never fitted Maree O'Connor well. Sewing offered her a solution - allowing her to use beautiful fabrics to make garments that fit just right. One day, while on the lookout for colourful prints to make new dresses, she spotted some ""amazing"" fabrics being sold online. Enticed by a yellow floral pattern and another black-and-white abstract design, she splashed out $600 (£450, A$900) on three orders. Months later, none had arrived. It was October 2024, and tired of waiting, the legal studies teacher from Melbourne, Australia, decided to set up a Facebook group to try to find out if anyone else was in the same boat. The group exploded. Within two weeks it had drawn hundreds of members, according to Ms O'Connor. She had unearthed a scandal that would consume the sewing world - from China to Europe, to the US. In the group, other sewing enthusiasts detailed how they too had been waiting months - and in some cases years - for fabrics to arrive, while a supplier alleged it was owed tens of thousands of dollars. At the centre of the controversy was globally renowned designer, Nerida Hansen. Her company had grown rapidly during the pandemic, when she made a name for herself selling bold, distinctive fashion prints that set her shop apart from other retailers. Popular with sewists - as members of the sewing community call themselves - around the world, her fabrics often appeared in influencers' Instagram posts. Some newspapers had even dubbed her Australia's queen of fabrics. ""People liked what she was doing and producing,"" said UK-based artist Gabriela Larios, who has worked with Ms Hansen. ""My impression of her was that she was doing something different and new in Australia,"" added Sarah Rowe, another artist who worked with Ms Hansen. ""I was impressed by her, she was formidable."" That's exactly what excited Bergen Anderson, who ordered more than $3,300 (£2,500; A$5,000) of Ms Hansen's fabrics in 2024. She planned to use them to make clothes which she would sell through her US-based children's clothing business. But, as in Ms O'Connor's experience, none of Ms Anderson's goods arrived within the eight-week window that was promised. Instead, she received a number of what she described as ""generic"" emails, saying her orders were soon to be printed and shipped. She also received a number of emails from Ms Hansen saying suppliers were delayed sending goods because of events like national holidays. ""It was every excuse under the sun,"" Ms Anderson said. Frustrated and in search of answers, she too stumbled upon Ms O'Connor's Facebook group. In it, she found customers wondering where their money had gone - and why the company was still accepting orders even though so many people were saying their fabrics hadn't been printed or shipped. Suspicious of Ms Hansen's business practices, Ms O'Connor encouraged customers to request refunds and dispute transactions with their banks. Ms Anderson only managed to get two out of three payments reversed through her bank, meaning she was still $808 (£606; A$1,224) out of pocket. Meanwhile, Ms Hansen had become aware of the Facebook group and contacted Ms O'Connor asking for it to be taken down, claiming that content posted in the group was defamatory - a claim Ms O'Connor rejected. Ms O'Connor said Ms Hansen also offered her an immediate refund if she no longer wished to wait for her goods. ""I got my refund pretty much straight away, because she wanted to shut me up."" But she decided not to shut up - or delete the group. ""She was just going to continue to do what she was doing, and take money from people because people were siloed right, they didn't know what was going on."" In the group people were sounding alarm bells about announcements from Ms Hansen saying she was rebranding, worried about what that would mean for their undelivered orders. Ms Hansen went on to trade under a number of different business names online. By then the group had grown beyond disgruntled customers to also include Nerida Hansen's suppliers. William Shan worked for a supplier in China that sold material to Ms Hansen's company - until, he said, the payments stopped. He was ""helpless"" when he ""accidentally discovered"" the Facebook group, he said. Mr Shan alleged Ms Hansen's firm failed to pay for two fabric shipments worth $52,000 (£39,000; A$78,700) in 2022. He said he initially felt sympathy for Ms Hansen, who he thought ""may have encountered difficulties"". He continued supplying her in the hope it would ""help her recover as soon as possible and collect her [company's] debts"". But he says later orders - worth thousands of dollars - also went unpaid. ""We [trusted Nerida] too much. From 2020 to the end of 2021, Nerida's credit [had] been consistently good. So we did this stupid thing of continuing to supply her,"" Mr Shan said. Mr Shan's company said it had hired numerous lawyers to try to recover the money owed by Ms Hansen's companies, but she and her business associates stopped communicating. The BBC also spoke to 11 artists and illustrators who said they had not been paid for their work with Ms Hansen's brand. Clémence Albertus, based in France, said she had been approached by Ms Hansen at an art fair in Paris about collaborating on fabric prints. Given Ms Hansen was ""really known for her fabrics"", Ms Albertus said she chose to trust her. According to Ms Albertus, Ms Hansen wanted to license one of her designs to be sold in collaboration with a large European fabric retailer called Verhees - an opportunity Ms Albertus didn't want to miss out on. But after sending over her design, a delicate floral print, she heard nothing from Ms Hansen for months. ""I thought Verhees changed their mind, or that the collaboration Nerida x Verhees failed,"" Ms Albertus said. That was until one day in August last year, when she discovered her pattern ""by chance"" for sale on the Verhees website. She said it had been edited in different colourways without her consultation. Ms Albertus contacted Ms Hansen numerous times asking about royalty statements and payment details but is yet to receive any money. ""It has been a real deception,"" she said, adding that she estimates she is owed €2,000-€4,000 (£1750-3500; A$3,500-7,000). Verhees told the BBC it was not responsible for royalty payments owed to designers featured in its collection, and that Ms Hansen was solely responsible for paying these. It added it had now suspended the Nerida Hansen x Verhees collaboration. Not all the artists who spoke to the BBC felt Ms Hansen was totally to blame for the lack of payments from her businesses. Bron Alexander, based in New Zealand, said while she was owed payments for previous projects with Ms Hansen, it was her own fault she hadn't been paid for her Verhees collection work as she'd failed to provide invoices when asked by Ms Hansen's team. Ms Alexander added that she believed Ms Hansen was a ""visionary"" and said she had ""much empathy"" for her financial situation. ""She only ever wanted us [artists] to be successful."" Others insisted business simply wasn't Ms Hansen's forte. ""I truly believe she wanted the best for everybody, I truly believe she wanted to be able to deliver, I truly believe she wanted to be able to pay everybody,"" said Sarah Rowe, an artist who used to collaborate with Ms Hansen and is not owed any money. ""I really believe she had good intentions to do all those things, and I also believe business is not her jam."" Ms O'Connor felt differently. ""I think she's quite intentional in what she's doing,"" she said. ""If she was a disorganised businesswoman she would have quit a while ago."" In September 2025, nearly a year after Ms O'Connor started the Facebook group, a public warning against Ms Hansen and her businesses was issued by the Victoria state consumer rights agency. It was the result of multiple complaints - Ms O'Connor had advised fellow customers on the group to report their experiences to Australian authorities. ""I urge consumers to be wary about purchasing goods from Hansen's online platforms or engaging further with Hansen,"" Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV) director Nicole Rich said. The warning said that over the course of one year, the agency had been contacted more than 120 times by customers claiming to have lost more than $19,800 (£14,900; A$30,000) in purchases. It also said Ms Hansen had operated online under a range of business names, including Indigo Palm, The Kind Merch Co, Nerida Hansen Fabrics, Rebel Quilts, Australian Surface Art Collective, Fabric and Design and Nerida Hansen Print and Textiles. Ms Hansen said this was untrue, denying she used all of these to trade. After the warning was issued, Ms Hansen announced she would be shutting down her businesses by the end of the month to start a new career. But she continued promoting fabric sales on the website domain names Global De-stash and neridahansen.com into November. In a statement to the BBC, Ms Hansen admitted she had made some ""very poor"" decisions relating to her businesses, adding her actions had caused her ""great shame and embarrassment"". She said she had experienced financial difficulties that led to her liquidating her company in late 2022 - before opening a new one in a new name. Following that, she said she fell further behind with orders in 2024, citing supplier issues and business mismanagement, but insisted she was still in control of the situation. ""Even though I mismanaged orders terribly I was steering my own business wheel,"" she said. She had intended to have all orders completed by the end of January 2025, she said, but the creation of the Facebook group had led to a wave of refund requests and bank chargebacks being submitted all at the same time. This left the business overwhelmed, Ms Hansen said, and caused her trading account to be frozen. She still intended to fulfil every order and refund owed to her customers, she stated, but did not currently have the means to do so. She alleged the attention brought to her businesses online by Ms O'Connor's Facebook group had amounted to ""horrific social media harassment"" and defamation. She claimed Ms O'Connor went beyond advocating for justice online. She accused her of encouraging others in the Facebook group to engage in what she describes as amounting to ""digital stalking"" and ""physical stalking"", and that Ms O'Connor ""publicly made deliberate attempts to sabotage [her] livelihood"". Ms O'Connor disputed these allegations saying they were ""outrageous"". ""Customers being persistent and demanding in terms of seeking a refund or product that the vendor had happily taken money for is not harassment,"" she said. Despite everything that has happened, Ms O'Connor is determined to continue sewing - though she insists she will never wear any of Nerida Hansen's designs again. She will continue to fight until Ms Hansen's businesses are shut down, she says. ""Some people are still awaiting justice and we hope that can be achieved."""
China US,PIP withdrawn from amputee over cricket video,2025-12-04T06:40:46.648Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9z00y2p1yo,"The family of a man who lost his leg when he was two years old have asked for a rethink of a decision to strip him of his disability benefits and force him to pay back £36,000. Shaun Rigby from Telford had his Personal Independence Payment (PIP) withdrawn after a video emerged, showing him take part in a game of cricket. But his family said: ""Playing cricket does not negate Shaun's disability; it showcases his determination to lead a fulfilling life despite it."" The Department of Work and Pensions said its decision had been backed by an independent tribunal and PIPs were ""awarded based on how a condition impacts a person's day-to-day needs, as opposed to the condition itself"". In an online petition, Mr Rigby's family said he had ""overcome incredible odds since losing his leg below the knee in a tragic tractor accident when he was just two years old"". They said despite his physical challenges, the 37-year-old had tried to ""live as fully as possible, embracing activities like cricket not only for his own mental and physical health but also to share joyful moments with his family"". Mr Rigby said he used to play for England's disability cricket team, before eventually having to give it up. He said: ""I stopped playing about 2014, just because I couldn't do what I wanted to do, my body was sort of breaking down."" Since then, he said the pain became worse and he was successful in applying for PIP in 2016 and a Motability car three years later. But the DWP decided to withdraw both after their attention was drawn to the video of him playing cricket in 2023. His family said it had been ""a light-hearted community cricket match"". They argued that ""participating in adaptive sports is a well-known form of rehabilitation and psychological well-being for individuals with disabilities"". The decision to strip him of his benefits took away his independence and his ability to care for his family, they said. Mr Rigby said he understood why the DWP had made the decision, but wanted the government department to know he played despite his condition and did it partly to inspire others. He said he would undergo six days of ""torture"" after playing, because of the pain. The family has asked the DWP to reassess his case and reverse the decision. His wife, Lauren, said losing the PIP payments was difficult in itself, but the thought of having to repay the £36,000 was causing the family ""stress and worry"". ""Do they want us to go into poverty?"" she asked. Mrs Rigby added she wanted to push back at some of the negative comments they had received after it was announced he would lose the payment, but that there had been ""nothing but good comments"" since the online petition was launched. The DWP said: ""Following Mr Rigby's appeal, where he was able to challenge his benefit entitlement, an independent tribunal agreed with DWP's decision."" It also said that every PIP claim was different, because of individual circumstances  ""including age and the ability to manage a condition without supervision or assistance"". Mr Rigby is waiting to hear what the weekly repayments will be on the £36,000 and believes it could be up to £35 a week. The DWP said it was committed to working with anyone struggling with repayment terms."
China US,Sale of Daily Telegraph collapses after US firm pulls out,2025-11-14T14:43:29.958Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993drmj1dyo,"US investment group RedBird Capital has pulled out of a deal to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph for £500m. RedBird had a previous attempt to buy the Telegraph rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi's IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family. A law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals. The new bid complied with that rule, but it is understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review. A spokesman for the group said: ""RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group. ""We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and we will work hard to help secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers."" Sources close to RedBird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest. RedBird itself has faced questions over the extent of investment it has received from China and Gulf based investors. An IMI Group spokesperson said its ""priority has been to end the uncertainty and secure the Telegraph's long-term success"" and that it remained in contact with ""interested parties"" on a deal. It said it remained committed to completing a sale, while co-operating with the government and regulators. RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market. Among other investments, RedBird Capital owns the Italian football team AC Milan. The Daily Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the RedBird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph's previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers."
China US,"'Tell me, how do I make money Rachel Reeves?'",2025-11-30T06:25:48.578Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75vwg51wxgo,"Once a chancellor has delivered their Budget speech in Parliament, it is usual they visit somewhere for a photo opportunity and pitch policies to the country. Rachel Reeves chose a London hospital to highlight her commitment to the NHS. But she would have been very welcome in Braintree, Essex, at Toast – an East Anglian coffee chain that sources many of its ingredients locally. Whether she would have enjoyed hearing the thoughts of owner Rob Ely is a different matter. ""It feels like the government are literally taxing us on everything they possibly can,"" he said. Mr Ely is reeling from what he feels is another blow for his business, after a recent rise in national insurance payments and pension contributions. ""I would absolutely welcome Rachel Reeves - come to my business. I will give you an open book. You tell me how I make money?"" Mr Ely has six coffee shops.  When we meet in person, nearly every table in his Colchester store is full at lunchtime and there is a steady stream of customers coming in for their takeaway brews. He wants a profit margin of 10% but says increased taxes, costs and wages mean it is not achievable, leaving him frustrated. an hour from April - slightly higher than the current inflation rate of 3.6% - and 8.5% for 18-20 year-olds to £10.85 . ""It's fantastic for all of those people that are going to get more money in their pocket, he said. ""I heard the Chief Secretary [to the Treasury] said it is a slight increase.  That is not a slight increase, it is a big increase. It is going to cost me £70-£80,000 a year,"" Mr Ely claimed. Prices at Toast almost certainly will have to go up, but he said there is a limit to how much people will hand over for a cup of coffee. Matt Kimber is standing on his bustling Basildon factory floor. ""I'm genuinely more positive than I was"" he said after the Budget Mr Kimber is managing director of family-run metal works company GK Engineering. It makes steel structures like staircases for NHS hospitals and new apartment blocks.  The firm employs 50 people and has a £9m turnover. ""We've seen some good things about public spending in our sector. There's some good things about apprenticeships. We are not overly impacted by minimum wage.  They are a skilled workforce so we are above minimum wage,"" the 36 year-old boss said. But Mr Kimber feels there is still ""some uncertainty"" as a lot of the measures announced won't start for a couple of years. Darren Sharp is one of the welders at GK Engineering and he feels in the past five years things have got financially tighter. The Chancellor said ""cutting the cost of living"" was one of her three priorities in the Budget - along with cutting NHS waiting times and the cost of debt. But after this Budget, Mr Sharp said: ""For me personally, it's not going have that much of an effect. ""I don't think they have been spending money in the right places. I would like to see them spend more on defence with threats from Russia and China."" He has older children so will not be affected by the two-child benefit cap being scrapped but the 54 year-old welcomed the freezing of prescription charges. The owner of the Dragonfly Lounge in Colchester, an LGBTQ+ bar and community space, was uncertain of its future pre-Budget. Jo Palmer-Tweed said Rachel Reeves' second Budget was ""a mixed bag"". ""I'm very pleased about the business rates decision for hospitality because that is potentially quite a big cut.  That was very pleasing,"" she said. The Chancellor announced that there will be permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses from next year in properties with an annual rental value less than £500,000. The Dragonfly Lounge opened earlier this year and its property hasn't been valued yet but Ms Palmer-Tweed is hopeful it will lead to a reduction. She said they will be ""impacted"" by the rise in national living wage and the freezing of the income tax thresholds. ""The income tax hikes are going to impact different parts of our customer base. ""Overall for us in the shorter term [the Budget] has been good for us. But in the longer term it's going to really depend in how it shakes out in terms of customer spending,"" the owner of the Dragonfly Lounge said. Before the Budget, Ms Palmer-Tweed, also known as Mamma Dragonfly, was worried whether they would survive next year as a safe space for the LGBQ+ community in Colchester to go out at night.  After the Budget she is more confident."" ""It improves our chances in the longer term. I think it is a really good start for Rachel Reeves but I think we could do more"". So a photo opportunity at the Dragonfly Lounge for the Chancellor might find some raising their glasses to her.  But if growth drags, taxes bite into disposable incomes and customers sashay away from the night time economy Rachel Reeves may face a tough crowd here."
China US,Marsh solar park plans questioned by campaigners,2025-11-27T06:00:25.703Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrvjkr1jxo,"Campaigners against proposals to build three large-scale solar parks claim the government's ambition to treble the amount of solar capacity in the UK is ""fundamentally flawed"" and ""damaging"". Amanda Farrant, who lives near the proposed Shepway Energy Park, says if plans are approved it would be ""like living in the middle of a massive, great big solar power station"". Three solar parks being put forward for Romney Marsh in Kent are at various stages of planning and consultation. None have yet been submitted to the planning inspectorate. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said solar contributed in 2024. Opponents to the Romney Marsh plans they will damage unique and fragile habitats and take up productive farm land. Ms Farrant, who formed the Hands Off Our Marsh campaign, believes there are better options to solar energy calling it ""too intermittent"" and that the government's solar ambitions are generating a solar ""gold rush"". ""It's all about speed and getting it done quickly,"" she claimed, adding the approach could lead to ""devastation"" of the rural environment. There is scepticism from some about the effectiveness of solar panels. Prof Tony Day, an independent energy consultant and visiting professor at London South Bank University, said the government target would only deliver 2-3.5% of national energy needs in the depths of winter. ""Even in the peak of summer the average monthly power output is around one fifth of headline capacity figure,"" Prof Day said. ""No other generation asset would be considered viable with this type of delivery or energy risk profile."" The government's hopes the UK will have 45-47GW of solar capacity by 2030. Proposals for a 500MW South Kent Energy Park in Old Romney would see more than 1,400 acres turned over to solar. Plans for the 200MW Shepway Energy Park, near Newchurch, see an area made up of six sites covering more than 1,000 acres. South Brooks Solar Farm's 500MW plan is made up of several sites potentially over more than 2,700 acres. If approved they would be three of the biggest solar parks in the country. Due to the size of the proposals they are classed as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) and the decision to approve or reject the plans is made at a national level, not by local councils. Since coming to power Labour has approved 11 NSIP solar parks around the UK. Colin Woollard, who lives and works on Romney Marsh, bought 256 solar panels from China in 2023 to power his motorsport engineering manufacturing business, with a 140KW capacity. He says when he bought them he was sold the idea that it would work all year round. ""It just doesn't,"" he said. Mr Woollard said on a cloudy day in November they only generated 21 kilowatts, which he said was ""basically seven kettles of water"". He questioned the ability to ""run a country"" on such an inefficient model. The government says solar offers potential to boost the country's energy independence, bring down bills and tackle the climate crisis. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""Solar is one of the cheapest forms of power and – alongside upgrades to the electricity grid – will help us get us off fossil fuels and delivering energy security so we can get bills down for good. ""All projects are subject to rigorous planning processes, and the views of the local community must be taken into account."" The three developers of the proposed sites said they had consulted residents and that the feedback would help to inform the projects."
China US,"We will be hammered in the budget, says 64-year-old",2025-11-21T06:03:47.304Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8e7zv510no,"A man in his sixties with disabilities says he feels he will ""get hammered"" whatever happens in the Budget announcement on 26 November. Andy Watson, 64, lives in Stotfold, Bedfordshire, and has serious mobility problems. He has also had a liver transplant and two types of cancer. He says he was hoping that some of the in the budget do not turn out to be true. When sitting with a cigarette in his mouth in the room where he spends most of his life, Andy Watson does not look like a survivor. But somehow, he says, he is still ""living and breathing"". After receiving a lung transplant 22 years ago, he was diagnosed with lung cancer eight years ago. Bowel cancer followed in 2022, along with back problems. ""My spine is poking into the spinal cord,"" he said, ""so walking is very difficult, very very painful. ""I've been receiving injections in the spine for the last few years, but you're only allowed so many of them and they stopped."" Mr Watson says he is on a waiting list for hospital treatment, but in the meantime  his mobility is ""lousy"" so he is ""stuck in the house"" apart from visits to a nearby coffee shop. ""Whatever happens in the budget,"" he said, ""we know we're going to get hammered. ""I'm just hoping [the government] are going to breach their manifesto and there's a call to arms by everybody for them to have another election. ""It's gone beyond the point of saying 'yeah, they've just got in, they've got to find their feet'."" Mr Watson believes the economy has only got worse over the past 18 months and the government is ""just investing more and more money on immigrants"". He believes paying £49.18 a week to asylum seekers has resulted in the government being forced to consider new unpopular charges in the budget. He also spoke against the government housing migrants in hotels as the accommodation was ""still a hotel, still a nice little holiday joint"". concluded that while the media and politicians ""depict people seeking asylum as living in luxury...  the reality could not be more different."" The government said it would , saving the taxpayer billions of pounds. Mr Watson says pensioners are suffering financially despite ""contributing to the country all these years - but Mr Starmer don't think about that, it's a joke"". The state pension is currently £230.25 per week while the allowance for an asylum seeker goes down to £9.95 per week if their accommodation supplies meals. Mr Watson said his own income, which is made up of a Personal Independence Payment, Employment and Support Allowance and a mobility allowance, was ""a couple of hundred pounds a week to live on [and I] contribute towards running a house, buying food"". Mr Watson said: ""[The government is] on about taxing your mileage. ""Scrap the road tax - just put it on the petrol [so] we're all paying equal."" A spokesperson for the Treasury said Vehicle Excise Duty was forecast to raise approximately £9.1bn in the current financial year, which would go towards funding public services. Mr Watson would like some measures in the budget to give him a little more income: ""I'm very lucky, my wife has retired, so she has a pension. ""She pays the majority of the bills and the running costs, other than that it's very, very tight. ""It would be lovely to be off on nice holidays and all the rest, but you can't do it."" He said he enjoyed a ""couple of little mini-breaks a year"" with his wife Liz in the UK. Before his health forced him to give up his job eight years ago, Mr Watson was running a shop selling mobility aids. ""We miss it,"" he says, ""we miss the banter - it was lovely to help people."" Although he has left the world of business behind, he has a keen interest in what owners of small businesses are going through. At the moment, bosses have to register for VAT if their turnover over 12 months is greater than £90,000. The think tank, The Resolution Foundation, has suggested the government drops the threshold to just £30,000 to increase competition, but Mr Watson is not impressed. ""What a joke,"" he said, ""I know a few shopkeepers, they're closing earlier now, because they are frightened to death of going over and into the VAT."""
China US,Shock in Cameroon as 74-year-old opposition firebrand dies in detention,2025-12-01T17:38:50.481Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9204y4w5o,"Left-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced. Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election. Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. . No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied. According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend. ""We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,"" he said. He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary. Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details. ""The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,"" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October. Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party. He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death. Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as ""the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame"" that burned for democratic emancipation. Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation. ""One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,"" Muna said. According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection. ""He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,"" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as ""illegal"". In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and . His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online. Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces. Ekane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate. Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate. At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN. This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were ""firing at point-blank range at the people"". The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing."
China US,The contradiction at the heart of the trillion-dollar AI race,2025-11-19T13:52:41.501Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvynlxqdyo,"But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. ""AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on,"" he insists. ""It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions."" But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a ""sudden correction"" in global financial markets, saying ""market valuations appear stretched"" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that ""there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now"". Asked whether from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us."" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these ""inflection points"": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. ""Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence."" But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is ""palpably exciting"" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: ""It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… ""So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: ""restricted"". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term ""AI factories"" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: ""I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!"" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: ""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough."" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. ""I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,"" he said. But he also said: ""What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure."" Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. ""I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,"" he told me. ""Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it."" But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: ""truth matters"". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? ""I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,"" he adds. ""I think that will have consequences."" Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about ""irrational exuberance"". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century."

She described the decline in reading enjoyment as ""a catastrophe"", as National Literacy Trust report shows the reading crisis persists. Oxford Brookes University chancellor and author Paterson Joseph, who will be part of the fair for a second year, said ""we just need to be clever about how we deliver books to children and how"". Mrs Vetta said that at seven, she would walk a mile and a half to her local library every Saturday. ""I would take Enid Blyton's The Famous Five, but I also took out books on China, on India.""

""Not only are you learning a greater vocabulary, you're also understanding worlds that are very different to yours."" But shows reading for pleasure at ""its lowest in 20 years"". It is based on 114,970 responses on the reading habits of children and young people aged 5 to 18 from various backgrounds. With just 1 in 3 respondents saying they enjoyed reading in their free time in 2025, that marks ""a 36% decrease in reading enjoyment levels since we started asking about this in 2005"". ""I think we just need to be clever about how we deliver books to children and how,"" said Mr Joseph, who has an acting career in TV and film. ""How we get them interested in in the tactile nature of of having a copy in their hands and the beauty of a book, its colour, its weight, its smell, everything about it should be a delight."""

China US,Cameroon's opposition leader in The Gambia after fleeing for his safety ,2025-11-24T11:26:59.659Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dyjn1mne5o,"Cameroonian opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who is contesting the outcome of the presidential election, has fled to The Gambia for his safety, The Gambian government has said. Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he is the legitimate winner of the 12 October election, alleging that the result was rigged to give President Paul Biya, 92, an eighth term. The Gambian information ministry said on Sunday that Tchiroma Bakary arrived on 7 November and was allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds. Cameroon's government had threatened to put him on trial for allegedly inciting violent post-election demonstrations. He denied the allegation, and blamed the security forces for a crackdown on protesters. The government put the number of people killed in post-election violence at 16, but other organisations have given a higher death toll. Tchiroma Bakary has repeatedly promised to resist Biya's government until his ""victory"" in the election is recognised. Biya, the world's oldest president, has been in power for 43 years, and was declared the winner with 53.7% of the vote amid allegations of fraud. Tchiroma Bakary, who served in Biya's government for many years, came second with 35.2%. His resistance tactics have included calling for street protests and ""ghost town"" operations aimed at bringing cities and towns to a standstill. Until The Gambian government confirmed his presence, his whereabouts had remained a mystery although there was speculation that he had fled to another country in the region. ""He is being hosted temporarily in The Gambia purely on humanitarian grounds in the spirit of African solidarity and for the purpose of ensuring his safety while discussions continue to pursue a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the post-electoral tensions in Cameroon,"" The Gambian government said in a statement. The Gambian authorities said the country would not be used as a ""base for subversive activity against any state"". The BBC has reached out to the Cameroonian government for comment. Reacting to the announcement, The Gambia's main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) criticised the government for withholding the announcement of Tchiroma Bakary's arrival until Sunday. It said it raised ""serious questions about transparency, accountability, and respect for The Gambian people's right to know what actions are taken in their name"". However, the party said it was proud that Tchiroma Bakary could find ""safe sanctuary"" in The Gambia, adding that it was fully aware of how ""despotism operates and how dissenters are treated""."
China US,Profits fall at IT firm Kainos despite rising revenue and global expansion,2025-11-10T11:00:19.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4zz47ew0o,"IT firm Kainos, one of Northern Ireland's largest businesses, has made £32m in pre-tax profit in the first half of the financial year. Although revenues rose to £196.1m, increased costs from national insurance rises, investments and temporary staffing reduced profits by 16% on the previous year. The company is set to take four floors of the £40m office building currently under construction at Bankmore Square as its new headquarters, due to open in September 2027. Kainos employs more than 3,100 people globally, offering digital services to large institutional clients like public bodies and the NHS, as well as finance and HR products in partnership with US firm Workday. AI is the hottest topic in both technology and financial markets, with the value of individual companies in the sector . Kainos CEO Brendan Mooney told BBC News NI that AI was already an important part of the company's own operations. ""That's everything from how we do our software engineering to how we are able to do prototyping for clients in ever quicker timeframes. Some 65% of what we do on the engineering side is now supported by AI tools and we see productivity improvements around that."" While a lot of tools for clients are still at the ""experimentation"" stage, some narrower AI tools have already been rolled out by the company, including a chat bot for Leeds City Council intended to provide guidance for those in financial distress. Other clients, dealing with sensitive data or live systems, are more hesitant. ""Some of our clients will be the likes of the Home Office, the Passport Service, the Ministry of Defence. Some clients, I think rightfully, are cautious about - you give the model your data, there's no guarantee you get it back or it doesn't go somewhere else."" Forty-three percent of the company's half year revenue came from its international operations, with 120 new employees in Canada and entry to new markets in Australia and New Zealand. Brendan Mooney said that trend is likely to continue. ""At our current pace, in two years' time, the majority of our business will be generated elsewhere – even while our UK business grows as well. The opportunities are global for what we do."" Another key growth area for the company is in the health care sector. Revenues from the health sector increased by 33% to £29.6m with the company providing services to research bodies, as well as the NHS. With the Chancellor announcing as one of her priorities ahead of the Autumn Statement, there is likely to be an increased focus on boosting productivity and digital accessibility in the health service."
China US,Why India caps pollution reading at 500 when the air is far more toxic,2025-11-16T00:00:03.510Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6jgg0180o,"For millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge. For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days. This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500? India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as ""severe"" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the So why was that threshold introduced? ""It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,"" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation. But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher. ""International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,"" says Mr Beig. ""That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms."" The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment. Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms. Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds. ""WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,"" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading. In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board. Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air. ""The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,""  says Mr Pathak, adding that ""sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government"". According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology. ""National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,"" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, ""now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase"". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling."

The Reverend Mark Nam, of St John the Evangelist in Woodley, Berkshire, first learned about the Chinese Labour Corps in an online talk during the Covid pandemic and needs £15,000 for the memorial. He said it was now his ""passion… so that my children's children see there were people like us, of Chinese heritage, who stood shoulder to shoulder with British troops at their hour of need"". The men were recruited from the Chinese province of Shandong to do manual work behind the frontlines from 1916.

""A lot of people in this group are quite elderly. Hearing one gentleman say 'I hope I can see something established before I die' really touched me."" Having publicised the project online, he was approached by the cathedral and Mr Nam said an earmarked place for the memorial is an impressive spot. ""I thought it might be down a corridor, by the toilets or something,"" he said. ""It's within almost touching distance of Lord Nelson's tomb. It's great we have got the place. ""I suppose that is the easy bit. The hard bit is that I have to pay for it. ""I'm a parish priest, a vicar. I don't have money sloshing around in my cassock."" He is raising funds online to pay for the memorial, which he said would mark the men's contributions appropriately. ""I'm British-Chinese and Britain is my home and I want to see something on our shores,"" he added. ""France and Belgium have had memorials for several years and I would love to see Britain catch up and do this properly."""
China US,Our dogs' diversity can be traced back to the Stone Age,2025-11-13T19:00:29.556Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7j89ykro,"If you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable. But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought. ""When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,"" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study. She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago. In a paper , this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution. They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives. This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads. Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age. ""It's really surprising,"" she said. ""And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this."" Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle. This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication. Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food. Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near. As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: ""It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see. ""It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one."" For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In , a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China. They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years. I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back."

China US,Google boss says trillion-dollar AI investment boom has 'elements of irrationality',2025-11-18T12:16:04.197Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo,"Every company would be affected if the AI bubble were to burst, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet has told the BBC. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an ""extraordinary moment"", there was some ""irrationality"" in the current AI boom. It comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry. Asked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning. ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us,"" he said. In a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment, , and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs. The interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense. Alphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI. A particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation. As valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment. It has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed. This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds. In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of ""irrational exuberance"" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can ""overshoot"" in investment cycles like this. ""We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,"" he said. ""I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry . But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own ""full stack"" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence. The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was , committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years. Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop ""state of the art"" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London. For the first time, he said Google would ""over time"" take a step that is being pushed for in government to ""train our models"" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI ""superpower"" after the US and China. ""We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,"" Mr Pichai said. However, he also warned about the ""immense"" energy needs of AI, which made up , according to the International Energy Agency. Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,"" he said. He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies. ""The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,"" he said. AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it ""the most profound technology"" humankind had worked on. ""We will have to work through societal disruptions,"" he said, adding that it would also ""create new opportunities"". ""It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,"" he said. Those who do adapt to AI ""will do better"". ""It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools."" to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. ."
China US,From florist to drone maker: How the weapon became so mainstream,2025-11-14T22:24:18.224Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3ydv2ygro,"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is often described as the world's ""first drone war"". It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements. Now, she makes drones for use against the Russians. ""It was just an obvious decision for me,"" she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. ""I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military."" Ms Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed. ""I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones,"" she recalled. ""So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them."" These days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon. Combat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact. Before 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones. ""This has been the first full-blown drone war,"" says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare. ""There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They've become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians."" And not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan. ""You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power."" Ms Pettyjohn says. The world's biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Europe, Portugal's Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany's Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due in Swindon in southwest England at the end of November. Meanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be on new military drones. ""The sector is growing really quickly,"" said Mike Armstrong, Stark's managing director for the UK. ""I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we've seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon."" The growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down. Anti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport. Oleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company. ""We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones,"" he says. Since 2022, DroneShield's share price has ""We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us,"" Mr Vornik adds. As well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China's use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs. Munin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army. ""We're building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones,"" he says. ""It's a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it's coming in."" Experts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI). At the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger. But Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. ""That is going to be the next real shift. ""Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate."" In the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line. ""I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers. ""But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture."""
China US,Guinness maker appoints former Tesco boss to stem flagging sales,2025-11-10T13:53:50.155Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4021v7wepo,"A former Tesco boss has been appointed to the top job at Guinness-owner Diageo, as the biggest drinks firm in the world seeks to turn around its flagging sales. Sir Dave Lewis will take over the brewing giant on 1 January, after former chief executive Debra Crew quit in the summer after two years in charge. The firm has been battling weaker sales across its range despite a growth in Guinness sales, with shares recently falling to a 10-year low. Following the announcement of Sir Dave's appointment on Monday, Diageo's share price rose 7% in early trading. Diageo owns well-known brands including Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Captain Morgan rum, but has seen sales weakening in key markets, in particular the US and China. Sir Dave was chief executive of Tesco for six years until 2020, and before that had spent nearly 30 years at consumer goods giant Unilever. He will leave his current role as chairman of health firm Haleon. Diageo said its board felt Sir Dave had extensive chief executive experience and proven leadership skills ""that is right for Diageo at this time"". ""The market faces some headwinds but there are also significant opportunities,"" said Sir Dave. ""I look forward to working with the team to face these challenges and realise some of the opportunities in a way which creates shareholder value."" Diageo saw its operating profits decline to £3.2bn in the year to June - around 28% lower compared with the same period the year before - with net sales down 0.1%. It said there was ""clearly much more to do"" in what it called a challenging year, citing ""pressure on consumers"". Last week, Diageo forecast net sales growth would be flat to slightly down in the year ahead due to a ""weaker US consumer environment"" and lower sales across China. Rising inflation has led to people tightening their spending in recent times, with consumers cutting back on drinking and eating out. The firm has also been battling with changing drinking habits from younger people, who are opting to drink less alcohol than previous generations. ""Dave Lewis needs to put Diageo back on track quickly,"" said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. ""His style is to listen closely to customers and suppliers and work out what's gone wrong. The focus will be on repair work, not long-term growth."" Mr Coatsworth said the new boss earned the nicknam ""Drastic Dave"" while at Unilever ""because of his ability to make bold decisions without simply tinkering at the edges"". ""At Tesco, he walked away after saying his job to stabilise the business was done, rather than sticking around to take the business to the next level. One might suggest the same approach will apply to Diageo."" Sir Dave will replace Nik Jhangiani - Diageo's chief financial officer who has been acting as interim chief executive since Ms Crew resigned in July."
China US,At least 65 dead and hundreds missing after fire engulfs Hong Kong tower blocks,2025-11-27T12:52:42.992Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg165d7ppvo,"At least 65 people have been killed in a huge fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong - the city's deadliest blaze in more than 70 years. Some residents remain trapped inside the buildings, with more than 270 people unaccounted for, while 70 people are injured. Hundreds of firefighters have been tackling the blaze, which is now largely under control at all of the affected buildings at Wang Fuk Court. The housing complex had been undergoing extensive renovations when the fire began. The exact cause is unclear but police say materials on outside of the buildings may have facilitated its spread. Three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. The blaze broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, with flames and thick clouds of grey smoke seen billowing from the towers, dominating the city's skyline. By 18:22 local time, officials upgraded the fire to a level five - the most serious category. Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among those killed in the blaze. He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost. Ten other firefighters are also injured, according to the fire department. ""I am devastated,"" 65-year-old Jason Kong told news agency Reuters. ""I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do."" He said a neighbour had called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris and the risk posed from collapsing scaffolding, has hampered rescue efforts, but the fire department has so far rescued 55 people. ""Despite the complex conditions at the scene, the firefighters' rescue efforts will not stop,"" Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee told a news conference on Thursday evening. Mesh material and plastic sheets which were found on the outside of the buildings are not believed to be fireproof, while Styrofoam was also found on the buildings' windows. These materials may have allowed the fire to spread faster, police said. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" a police spokesperson said. Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption has said it will launch a criminal investigation over the renovation works. Fire safety expert Prof Jiang Liming, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said he believed the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks may have also helped the fire grow. Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight across Hong Kong - a city known for its high-rise buildings - and is widely used in construction. Lee said he had arranged inspections of ""all housing estates undergoing major repairs"" to check the ""safety of scaffolding and building materials"". He added that the government was considering a review of bamboo scaffolding and whether they should be replaced by metal frameworks. ""The government will stand united with all Hong Kong people, and we are confident that we will be able to get through this together,"" he said. Campaigning for the city's Legislative Council election on 7 December has been suspended. Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po district was built in 1983 and consists of eight tower blocks providing 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built. Some residents told local media that alarms did not sound when the fire began, and that they struggled to leave when the elevators stopped working. Kiko Ma, 33, who has an apartment in the housing complex, told the BBC that some of the fire alarms had been turned off during the renovation, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to enter and exit the buildings. There were also reports on Wednesday night of blasts being heard from inside the buildings, and of fire hoses struggling to reach the upper levels of the 31-storey towers. Police have evacuated nearby buildings, and several temporary shelters have been opened. One of the shelters, located across the road from the housing complex, was deemed unsafe as the fire raged, and evacuees were directed to another further away. Outside one of the shelters, a woman was seen holding her daughter's graduation photo as she searched for her family. ""She and her father are still not out yet,"" the 52-year-old told Reuters. ""They didn't have water to save our building."" An officer at a temporary shelter earlier told news agency AFP that it was unclear how many people were unaccounted for because residents were still trickling in late into the night to report missing family members. As dawn broke on Thursday morning, small fires remained visible from the outside of the still-smouldering buildings. Meanwhile, people have been turning up with food and clothes for displaced residents. Several well-known Chinese businesses have pledged donations to support relief efforts. Alibaba Group, which owns e-commerce platforms Temu and Taobao, said it would give HK$20 million ($2.6m; £1.9m). There is a large evacuation zone around the fire, roads are closed and more than 30 bus routes have been diverted, Hong Kong's Transport Department says. Thirteen nearby schools have suspended lessons, education officials said. China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported. Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record happened in 1948, which killed 176 people and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse."
China US,Mick Jagger makes surprise visit to his old school,2025-11-19T18:36:55.535Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3k3wejkkvo,"Sir Mick Jagger has advised the next generation of musicians to ""work really hard and not give up"" during a surprise visit to his former school. The Rolling Stones frontman visited The Mick Jagger Centre at Dartford Grammar School in Kent on Wednesday to mark the facility's 25th anniversary. The 82-year-old thanked music teachers at the performing arts centre who ""inspired children and young people in their musical careers"". Sir Mick told the BBC that young people aiming for a music career needed ""a lot of luck"" and to ""work really hard at it and not give up"". He said that ""music wasn't much of a career"" when he was growing up, but added: ""That all changed very, very quickly in the early 60s and I got on that bandwagon."" He opened The Mick Jagger Centre, home to the Dartford Music School and Dartford Symphony Orchestra, in 2000. The centre launched a programme of events in October to mark its 25th anniversary. Sir Mick said that visiting his former school ""brings back a lot of memories and it's nice to see the kids seem happy"". According to The Mick Jagger Centre, the singer funds its Red Rooster project offering free music tuition, including in local primary schools. ""If you can express yourself through song, drama, art, dance – all these things are important,"" Sir Mick added. ""My involvement's been honestly pretty minimal in a real way, but I do feel connected to it, and I think all the people involved with it have done a really wonderful job."" The school's headmaster, Julian Metcalf, said Sir Mick's return visit was ""very special and the icing on the cake"". ""He completely proved wrong that old adage that you should never meet your heroes. What a genuinely lovely guy,"" he told BBC Radio Kent. Mr Metcalf said Sir Mick watched a pupil concert - which ""he loved"" - and later performed on stage with students. ""It was unbelievable to watch,"" said the headteacher. ""You can take the boy out of Dartford, but you can never take the Dartford out of the boy. He has kept a real interest in Kent, Dartford and what is going on in the school."" Sir Mick first met The Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards on a platform at Dartford station, forming a friendship that would lead to the band's formation in 1962. The town has several streets named after The Rolling Stones songs, including Little Red Walk, Angie Mews and Ruby Tuesday Drive."
China US,Text scammers make tens of thousands a month - and spend it on designer shoes and bags ,2025-11-29T05:01:03.557Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4nzp6ezg7o,"""They don't keep money, they spend it here and now."" Det Ch Insp Paul Curtis is showing us around an evidence room piled high with designer shoes and handbags. Thousands of items are neatly stacked in plastic containers on wooden shelves. The items here have been seized from financial fraudsters, some of whom send scam texts - known as smishing - to victims. ""They like to live a lavish lifestyle,"" says Curtis. ""We have got somewhere between 8,500 and 10,000 items of evidence in this one room,"" he says, something that is ""the result of house searches and raids"" carried out by officers. The smell of fresh leather goods pervades the air. Brightly coloured Gucci stilettos catch the eye from a distance; it's a treasure trove of top-label kit worth tens of thousands of pounds. These purchases are an indication of how much cash they're making from their crimes and what they're spending it on. The term ""smishing"" is a combination of ""SMS"", or ""short message service"" - the technology behind text messages - and ""phishing"". Fraudsters send fake text messages - apparently from a bank or other trusted company - to trick people into disclosing personal information such as passwords and Pin numbers. The intention is to defraud them out of their money. Curtis is part of the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit - a team made up of officers from the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police service. Although they're London police forces, the unit has a national remit, and is sponsored by the banking industry. It focuses on combating financial fraud. ""In a recent smishing case of ours, the defendant was sentenced on the basis of sending 15,000 messages in a five day period. That equated to making a hundred thousand pounds a month,"" he says. The senior officer was talking about Ruichen Xiong, a student from China who was convicted of the crime after driving around London in March of this year, sending messages to tens of thousands of potential victims. Xiong was sentenced in June at Inner London Crown Court to 58 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to fraud by representation. According to Ofcom, half of UK mobile users said they received a suspicious message between November 2024 and February 2025 via text or iMessage. Gideon Rabinowitz, 64, lives in Newbury, Berkshire, and is a recent victim of smishing. Just two months ago, the former IT manager said he was cheated out of more than a thousand pounds after receiving a fraudulent text message. ""I felt like a massive fool, like I'd been violated,"" he says. ""It really shook me. For a number of days after it really left me quite shaken. I felt very vulnerable and I don't know who to trust now."" Mr Rabinowitz was led to believe he was being contacted by his bank who were reporting a suspicious payment on his account. In reality, he was being messaged by a scammer. ""It started with a text out of the blue asking if I recognised a transaction - yes or no. Two and half hours later I was out of pocket by £1400."" He adds: ""In part it was about the money and it was also this feeling of being defrauded, of being looked up, because these people knew who I was. They knew where I live"". Scam text messages often pretend to be from large companies such as utility companies, banks or supermarkets. They usually include a link. Once the person clicks on it, they can be sent to a fraudulent website and asked for personal and financial information. The information can then be used to convince them to transfer money from their account. Smishing is primarily done through two devices; a Sim farm which holds multiple Sim cards, allowing criminals to bombard people with thousands of scam texts. The second is what's called an SMS Blaster. It tricks mobiles nearby into connecting with it, and then sends large numbers of fraudulent texts in a matter of seconds. The government says ""smishing scams have a devastating impact on their victims"". ""Our Telecoms Charter sets out clear action to secure SMS and reduce fraud across the telecoms sector"". ""We are also banning Sim farms. Banning these devices used to send thousands of scam texts will close down a key tool for criminals and safeguard consumers,"" it says. The ban is expected to come into effect late next year. It will make the possession or supply of Sim farms, without a specified reason, illegal. One cyber expert said smishing was a difficult crime to solve and that there needs to be more education around fraudulent text messages. ""Smishing in and of itself is very hard to police because a lot of it comes from abroad and, even when it's done from within the UK it's very easy to do and hard to trace, "" says Ciaran Martin, the former Chief Executive of the National Cyber Security Centre. ""So while the police can sometimes take down big operations, we shouldn't look to the police as the strategic answer for this. ""The strategic answer is for people to understand that serious businesses don't ask you for money by text, and for businesses to find better ways of interacting with customers and verifying that interaction"". The advice from police is simple: do not click on the links in any unsolicited messages you receive. If you believe you're a victim of fraud, report to Action Fraud, report to your bank, and forward the message to 7726 so the mobile networks can investigate further."
China US,AI firm claims Chinese spies used its tech to automate cyber attacks,2025-11-14T12:16:51.557Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lzmygr84o,"The makers of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Claude claim to have caught hackers sponsored by the Chinese government using the tool to perform automated cyber attacks against around 30 global organisations. Anthropic said hackers tricked the chatbot into carrying out automated tasks under the guise of carrying out cyber security research. The company this was the ""first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign"". But sceptics are questioning the accuracy of that claim - and the motive behind it. Anthropic said it discovered the hacking attempts in mid-September. Pretending they were legitimate cyber security workers, hackers gave the chatbot small automated tasks which, when strung together, formed a ""highly sophisticated espionage campaign"". Researchers at Anthropic said they had ""high confidence"" the people carrying out the attacks were ""a Chinese state-sponsored group"". They said humans chose the targets - large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies – but the company would not be more specific. Hackers then built an unspecified programme using Claude's coding assistance to ""autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement"". Anthropic claims the chatbot was able to successfully breach various unnamed organisations, extract sensitive data and sort through it for valuable information. The company said it had since banned the hackers from using the chatbot and had notified affected companies and law enforcement. But Martin Zugec from cyber firm Bitdefender said the cyber security world had mixed feelings about the news. ""Anthropic's report makes bold, speculative claims but doesn't supply verifiable threat intelligence evidence,"" he said. ""Whilst the report does highlight a growing area of concern, it's important for us to be given as much information as possible about how these attacks happen so that we can assess and define the true danger of AI attacks."" Anthropic's announcement is perhaps the most high profile example of companies claiming bad actors are using AI tools to carry out automated hacks. It is the kind of danger many have been worried about, but other AI companies have also claimed that nation state hackers have used their products. In February 2024, OpenAI published a blog post in collaboration with cyber experts from Microsoft saying it had disrupted five state-affiliated actors, including some from China. ""These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,"" . Anthropic has not said how it concluded the hackers in this latest campaign were linked to the Chinese government. The Chinese embassy in the US told reporters it was not involved. It comes as some cyber security companies have been criticised for over-hyping cases where AI was used by hackers. Critics say the technology is still too unwieldy to be used for automated cyber attacks. In November, cyber experts at Google which highlighted growing concerns about AI being used by hackers to create brand new forms of malicious software. But the paper concluded the tools were not all that successful - and were only in a testing phase. The cyber security industry, like the AI business, is keen to say hackers are using the tech to target companies in order to boost the interest in their own products. In its blog post, Anthropic argued that the answer to stopping AI attackers is to use AI defenders. ""The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defence,"" the company claimed. And Anthropic admitted its chatbot made mistakes. For example, it made up fake login usernames and passwords and claimed to have extracted secret information which was in fact publicly available. ""This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,"" Anthropic said. to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. ."
China US,"Russian spy ship pointed lasers at RAF pilots tracking it, says UK",2025-11-19T19:07:00.819Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24028k7edo,"A Russian spy ship has used lasers for the first time to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters, the defence secretary has said. John Healey told reporters the ""deeply dangerous"" move from the Yantar was being taken ""extremely seriously"" by the government. He added that the vessel was north of Scotland and had entered UK waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks. The UK would continue monitoring the ship and had ""military options ready should the Yantar change course,"" he added. ""My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,"" he added. Healey said the laser incident took place whilst the Yantar was being followed by a Royal Navy frigate and RAF Poseidon P-8 planes deployed to ""track the vessel's every move"". It is understood the episode occurred within the last two weeks. Speaking at a news conference in Downing Street, the defence secretary added he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely ""when it is in our wider waters"". Healey said the vessel, which entered service in 2015, was part of Russia's Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), which was designed to ""undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict"". ""We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,"" he said. Asked about the risks posed by lasers, Healey replied: ""Anything that impedes, disrupts or puts at risk pilots in charge of British military planes is deeply dangerous."" The Russian Embassy released a statement, saying it was ""not interested in British underwater communications"". ""The actions of our country do not touch interests of the UK and they are not aimed at undermining its security,"" the statement said. It added: ""However, London, with its Russophobic path and increasing militaristic hysteria leads to further degradation European security, providing the premise for new dangerous situations. ""We call on the British side to hold off taking any destructive steps which might aggravate the crisis situation on the European continent."" Labour MP Matt Western, who chairs the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, said: ""Today's news demonstrates once again that Russia presents a genuine and immediate threat to the UK's security."" He added: ""I welcome the seriousness with which the defence secretary is treating this issue, but there is more we can do. More assertive retaliation may be required."" The defence secretary previously about the Yantar after it was spotted in UK waters in January, calling it ""another example of growing Russian aggression"". According to the ship tracking website Marine Traffic, the ship has not broadcast its location since 2 November, and was last tracked in the Baltic Sea north of the Latvian Coast. On 6 November, the Dutch Navy said two of its vessels escorted the Yantar out of the North Sea, where it was operating near Dutch territorial waters. While the Yantar's current position is not clear, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows an RAF Poseidon P-8 surveillance plane circling off the Scottish coast, although it is not certain that this is tracking the Yantar. Russia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables. Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American security think tank, said the Yantar's use of lasers was ""an escalation for sure"". ""Essentially, you do it to impede the pilots from doing their work,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""We don't know exactly how strong the lasers were, but even if they didn't blind the pilots, it was provocative,"" she added. The UK and its Nato allies are to offshore cables, pipelines and other infrastructure critical to internet connectivity. In his speech, the defence secretary warned about Russian incursions into Nato airspace, as well as the threats posed by China and armed conflicts around the world, adding: ""Our world is changing. It is less predictable. It is more dangerous."" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has come under for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack. The committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal. Healey said the UK government ""takes a different view"" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato. But he said the committee was ""right to say"" Britain should ""pick up the pace of our commitment"" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year. The report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme . The Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month. Healey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not ""at any price"", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part. It has been reported that the EU is demanding an entry fee running to billions of euros before the UK can take part. He added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be ""good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry""."
China US,"'I worked, I paid taxes - then the bank took my home'",2025-11-19T03:39:23.284Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jz321x14o,"""I am waiting for the bailiff to knock on the door, take my keys and kick me out,"" says Jose Da Costa Diogo, one of thousands of people who have been told this year their homes will be repossessed. The 65-year-old learned he would lose his home in Thetford, Norfolk, during a brisk 10-minute county court hearing earlier this year. The interest-only mortgage on the three-bedroom property was taken out more than 20 years ago in the hope he and his then wife would save up enough to eventually cover the capital sum. But the collapse of the marriage and his ex-wife's departure to Brazil in 2015, left Mr Da Costa Diogo unable to repay the £80,000 still outstanding. And because his ex-wife was still on both the mortgage documents and the property deeds, he was also unable to sell the property to cover the outstanding amount. ""I tried to do the right thing and carried on paying all the bills,"" he said. ""After 25 years, I have nothing to show... but I still have to carry on living. ""I'm going to be homeless."" Court figures - the highest number in five years. Experts say the rise is down to a variety of factors and the rise in the general cost of living. Mr Da Costa Diogo registered as homeless with Breckland Council, his local authority. He is far from alone. The BBC asked every English council with housing responsibilities how many people presented as homeless as a result of a mortgage repossession. The number has doubled, according to the 240 councils that provided comparable data - from 1,517 in 2022-23, to 2,370 in 2023-24. It was 3,406 in the most recent year. People in local government say rehoming those affected by repossessions is putting ever greater stress on council resources. Tom Hunt, who chairs the Local Government Association's Inclusive Growth Board, said: ""As more and more people turn to their council for help, local authorities are having to stretch budgets further. ""The temporary accommodation crisis facing councils is only worsening."" Lucy Davies sees the devastation repossessions can have on a daily basis. A housing law advisor with the Suffolk Law Centre, she volunteers her expertise to those in need at courts in Suffolk and Essex. ""I see the sheer number of people that this is affecting,"" said Ms Davies. ""People get into difficulties largely through no fault of their own. ""Quite often there's mental health, there's employment issues, there's family issues, and I think it can very quickly spiral out of control."" On the day the BBC joined Ms Davies for a day at Ipswich County Court, where she volunteers with the Ipswich County Court Advice and Representation Service, none of the five people facing mortgage repossession cases turned up. This, she said, was often a symptom of shame, despair and the sense that losing one's home is a foregone conclusion. ""It is quite frightening coming to court, but it doesn't have to be."" She urged people to seek advice as soon as possible and said the cases she was seeing were becoming ""more entrenched or more serious"". People were finding it increasingly difficult to access housing legal aid, she explained. Paul Gorton, of The Law Society's housing law committee, agreed. He said a historic lack of investment in legal aid meant fewer and fewer law firms were able to offer legal aid housing advice. ""Many people are too well off to be eligible for legal aid but cannot afford to pay for legal advice themselves,"" Mr Gorton said. ""We have both legal aid provider deserts and restrictive eligibility criteria leaving many people stuck in limbo."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it had recently announced ""the first major funding increase for housing legal aid in three decades - a 24% rise"". ""This investment will help ensure effective access to justice for some of the most vulnerable in our society, while supporting a more stable and sustainable legal aid sector,"" the spokesperson said. Seeking to repossess a home is ""always a last resort"" for lenders, said Karina Hutchins, a principal in the mortgage policy team at UK Finance, a trade association for the banking and financial services sector. She said while the number of mortgage repossessions had been creeping up in recent years, the current levels remained ""historically low"". ""Repossessions are really, really uncommon."" She said in the first quarter of 2025, about 2,000 homes were repossessed compared with 13,000 in the same quarter of 2009, in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. ""I can imagine that customers are really worried and distressed if they're facing financial difficulty, but they don't have to go through it alone,"" Ms Hutchins said. ""The earlier they get in touch with their mortgage lender, the more support and help that that lender can give them and the more likelihood they have of getting back up to date with their mortgage."" Options offered by lenders, she said, included reduced mortgage payments to allow time to get back on track, budgeting and other tools to understand ""their full financial situation"" and advice about debt charities and support organisations. Henry Sabati McRae, who lives in Croydon, south London, has so far managed to stave off repossession. A software developer by training, Mr McRae's financial woes came in the wake of the death of a brother in 2020 and his mother in October 2023. Since October 2024, the 51-year-old has been out of work and, despite applying for hundreds of jobs, he has not managed to get a new contract. ""It doesn't matter how much you have in savings,"" he said. ""Within a few months it is wiped out. I managed to stretch it as far as I could, because I'd been quite conservative with how I was doing."" Even so, the mortgage arrears on his two-bedroom flat eventually grew to about £13,000 and his bank said if that figure was not reduced to below £8,000 it would seek to repossess his home. ""The most important thing for me at that time, and I think for anybody, was keeping the roof over my head,"" he said. ""Otherwise it spirals out of control."" To scrape by, he has turned to selling off his possessions on an internet auction site and accepting a loan from a friend. Like many of those facing repossession action the BBC has spoken to, Mr McRae said the experience was deeply ""humiliating"" and that his instincts were initially ""to draw the curtains shut"". However, he said realising he was far from alone and in speaking about it has helped him plot out, like an IT problem, his ""solution to it"". Businessman Mike Williams, who lives 10 miles (16km) south of Mr McRae in Caterham, Surrey, has also avoided repossession. He took on the mortgage of his self-build home after he and his wife separated. In three years, repayments on the interest-only loan, which was taken out 20 years ago, have tripled. He says it has left him with ""next to no disposable income"". At court, he renegotiated a repayment plan which would add an extra 20% to his monthly payments. In five years, when the mortgage comes to term, he intends to sell the two-bedroom house which he and his wife built from the ground up. ""It has quite a bit of sentimental value to me, so yes it is heart-wrenching,"" he said. As for Mr Da Costa Diogo, his bank has repossessed the property. In the same month it was repossessed, the BBC saw a similar three-bedroom property in the same Thetford street as Mr Da Costa Diogo's on the market for £160,000 - almost double the amount he owed. Within hours of losing his home, he was given emergency accommodation in a small ground-floor studio in north Suffolk. ""I left my house with one suitcase and a bag of essentials and told the council 'I'm homeless'. ""It's a roof over my head. I'm trying to keep things simple because what is the point of complicating things? ""I'm alive and I carry on."" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day."
China US,On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet,2025-11-19T00:23:14.958Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91dk0l50no,"Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker. ""Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over."" Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt. ""I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,"" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin. This is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet""; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports. After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance. Some ""shadow"" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or ""spoofing"" their location data. Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of ""shadow"" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically ""floating rust buckets"", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, ""good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost"". Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: ""There's no secret made about it."" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as ""false"". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called , but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection. Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point ""where they just don't even bother at all"", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages. Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air that ""shadow"" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. While politicians , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea. The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it. Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event. ""There's a complexity associated with it,"" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. ""With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis."" The Estonians speak from experience. When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has ""constantly"" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk. The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken. ""Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,"" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, ""we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself"". ""Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies."" Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up. ""Thank you for your co-operation,"" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia. The exchange lasted just over five minutes. ""You need to see it in a larger perspective,"" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: ""This information can be used in our maritime surveillance."" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: ""You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels."" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile ""the dark fleet is getting darker"". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's ""anti-Russian sanctions"" were ""illegitimate"" and ""undermine established principles of global commerce"". ""Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,"" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to ""easily resolved"" issues such as administrative delays. It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had ""heightened"" the risks by ""forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape""."
China US,How a 'fertility gap' is fuelling the rise of one-child families,2025-12-05T14:39:45.809Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyv7211jljo,"""It was nice to hear someone giving it a name,"" she says. She and her husband have a five-year-old daughter called Joanie but they knew they probably wouldn't have a second child - not because they couldn't, but not out of choice, either: Natalie finds it hard to imagine having the time and money for one. ""You know you'd love that baby, everyone tells you, but there's a little teeny niggle where you think, 'what if I put my first in that position where she can't do the activity she wants to do because I've got to spread money out between two'?"" She adds: ""Is it okay to say you're only having one because they don't fit into modern ways of parenting?"" Modern parenting, for Natalie, 35, looks like family holidays with Joanie. It looks like weekday evenings hearing about her day at school and helping her with homework. But, with demanding jobs and no family living nearby to help with childcare, it also looks like an expensive childcare jigsaw. But ultimately, deciding whether or not to have a second is a tough decision. ""I think you worry you'd regret it,"" she says. The fertility rate was 1.41 children per woman in England and Wales last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest on record for a third year running. Separately, the proportion of families with one dependent child has grown since the turn of the century - that includes families with one child, as well as those who also have children over 18 or may have left home. They made up 44% of all families in England and Wales with dependent children living with them, up from 42% in 2000. (Though the peak was 47% in the early 2010s, which then dipped before picking up again after Covid.) The UK's falling birth rate is part of what the United Nations calls a ""global fertility slump"", which it puts down, in part, to money worries. People aren't ""turning their backs on parenthood"", says the UN in a summary of its Population Fund's State of World Population report, which surveyed people across 14 countries. Instead it says they ""are being denied the freedom to start families due to skyrocketing living costs, persistent gender inequality and deepening uncertainty about the future"". Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said earlier this year that she wants ""more young people to have children, if they so choose"". She pointed to the expansion of funded childcare hours in England as a way the government was trying to recover ""dashed dreams"". Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England did fall this year for the first time in 15 years, . They are now an average of £12,425, down 22% on the previous year. However they are slightly up in Scotland and Wales, at £12,468 and £15,038 respectively. A study from University College London (UCL) last year suggested two-fifths of 32-year-olds in England want children – or more children, if they are already parents – but only one in four of them are actively trying to conceive. Dr Paula Sheppard, an anthropologist at the University of Oxford, believes parents in the West still think of having two children as ""the norm"". However, she says there is a ""fertility gap"" and that ""for every three kids wanted… only two are born"". ""A lot of this gap is driven by… people starting families later and later in life,"" she explains – often a result of education and career opportunities for women and changing gender roles. ""It becomes a whole lot more difficult to get pregnant [and] it becomes a whole lot more difficult to keep the pregnancy."" The falling birthrate is giving education policymakers a headache. The number of pupils in England has dropped by 150,000 since 2019, and will fall by a further 400,000 by the end of the decade, according to the Education Policy Institute. Schools are given money per pupil, so fewer pupils means less cash. Less cash, in turn, is an issue for those head teachers struggling to fund staffing and resources. About a year ago, a post on a UK Reddit thread for teachers raised what one contributor saw as another potential impact of more only children on the education system. The contributor wrote that they had seen a rise in ""spoilt"" children with ""demanding behaviour due to overindulgent parenting"". These children tended to have siblings who were much older or no siblings at all, they claimed. The idea that children without siblings may be selfish or spoiled dates back to research conducted in the late 19th century by psychologists G Stanley Hall and E W Bohannon. ""Selfishness is one of the most striking traits of the only children in families,"" they wrote in their Study of Peculiar and Exceptional Children. ""'The only child' is deficient on the social side."" But more recent studies have debunked that idea. ""Numerous studies have disproven these myths that only children are maladjusted, spoiled, and lonely,"" explains Dr Adriean Mancillas, a psychologist and professor in California State University's education department. Dr Mancillas has spent her career exploring family dynamics, the development of only children, and mental health intervention in schools - and says most research ""consistently demonstrates advantages of being an only child, particularly in educational and academic outcomes"". This is down, mainly, to a theory called ""resource dilution"". In simple terms, she says this means parents with one child ""are able to be more involved in their child's education"". ""Children with siblings share in parents' time, emotional support, attention, and financial resources whereas the only child does not,"" says Dr Mancillas. ""This singular focus of resources tends to provide academic advantages for the only child."" She points to some research that suggests many only children did better academically when schools closed to most pupils in lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, ""because of the relative availability of parental resources"". ""Resource dilution"" is one of three social science theories about the consequences of being an only child, according to University College London (UCL) academics. The second is ""confluence theory"", which also suggests that only children perform better than children with siblings academically because a family's ""intellectual environment"" declines as the number of children grows. Then there is ""socialisation theory"" which, in contrast, argues that siblings help children learn how to share, negotiate and resolve conflict. Existing research, according to the UCL academics, support the first two theories. But, like Dr Mancillas, they say it ""generally does not support the socialisation theory as it finds that only children are comparable to children with siblings (especially those with few siblings) in terms of personality, parent-child relationships, achievement, motivation and personal adjustment"". Dr Mancillas suggests there could be something else feeding into only children's better academic performance, too. ""Studies show that parents with one child tend to have attained higher educational outcomes themselves than parents of multiple children,"" she says. ""Much of the time, parents have delayed having children in order to complete career or higher educational goals. This would suggest that parents who have one child likely place a high value on education overall."" Earlier this year, Susan Newman, an American psychologist explored so-called only-child dynasties - where parents who are only-children, have one child themselves - in an article to accompany her new book, Just One: The New Science, Secrets & Joy of Parenting an Only Child. One of the most surprising findings from the new research for her book was, she wrote: ""Adult only-children are increasingly choosing to have ""just one"" child themselves. ""The resulting only-child dynasties underscore the trend. Count on seeing more of them, most noticeably without the spoiled, entitled 'little emperors' we heard so much about for so long -despite a lack of evidence to support such misinformed stereotypes."" The phrase has been used as shorthand to describe the only children born under China's one-child policy, the idea held by some being that it led to a generation of ""solitary children pampered and paraded with a retinue of parents and elders"". However, while the policy did leave a lasting legacy after its end in 2015 - an ageing population, for example, and a gender imbalance because of a traditional preference for male children - research has suggested that the ""little emperor effect"" has not been a part of it. There were ""very few only-child effects"" on children's personality, according to a study of Chinese schoolchildren carried out by American researchers at two Texas Universities. The phrase ""one and done"" was only just beginning to emerge when New York-based journalist Lauren Sandler began writing her 2013 book, One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One. ""I would be on the subway with my adorable child and someone would say, 'so cute, when are you having another one?' ""There is so little discussion about what it means to have single children, which is incredible to me considering how many there are."" She adds: ""I think that people feel very alone in this."" She began to question why some people assumed she would want more children, something she also explored for her work. It used to be that having larger families was how we survived, she points out. ""A family was a workforce, and that was very much a necessity until the industrial revolution."" Only after the industrial revolution, and the introduction of child labour and welfare laws did that change. ""The opportunity costs and the economic costs of children shifted dramatically,"" she explains. She also questioned the negative connotations that can sometimes be associated with having one child. ""There's also a lot of research that shows that only children do not take relationships for granted at a very, very young age. So, [it's not the same as when you] fight with your older brother and then just, through exposure, need to make up again. ""These people aren't going to be at the dinner table with you every night. Because of that, there's a lot of care that seems to come into relationships. And so that is sort of the opposite of the selfish stereotype of only children."" So teachers may not really have a generation of ""little emperors"" on their hands. But the is still very much being felt by some schools, and more widely too. Policymakers, for example, are grappling with the impact of the UK's ageing population on public services, taxes, and the growing cost of state pensions. ""Falling birth rates and an ageing population can create pressures on public services and public finances because the balance between the number of people working and the number of people drawing on age-related services changes over time,"" says Dr Alina Pelikh of University College London, who specialises in demography. ""Governments may need to consider adjustments - whether through pension age, contributions, or other measures - to ensure long-term sustainability."" The concerns are global, and governments around the world are trying to encourage people to have more children. US President Donald Trump has mentioned the idea of a $5,000 ""baby bonus"". Poland has just introduced a policy of zero personal income tax for families with two or more children. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has introduced tax exemptions for mothers. But for all the the statistics and policymaking this is, ultimately, a very personal decision. Natalie couldn't be prouder of her daughter, who has recently been made ""values ambassador"" in her class, encouraging other children to show empathy and respect. ""She has been chosen, not because she's an only child, because they don't know whether she's got siblings or not. She's been chosen based on her personality,"" says Natalie. ""I don't think I was ever worried about not giving her [a sibling], because you can never have a child for somebody else. ""You've got to have a child for yourself, haven't you?"""
China US,US calls for international action to cut weapons supply to Sudan paramilitaries,2025-11-14T08:20:20.531Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1nwy7q8o,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are accused of mass killings in el-Fasher. At the end of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada, Rubio said the RSF had committed systematic atrocities, including murder, rape and sexual violence against civilians. Sudan's army accuses the United Arab Emirates of propping up the RSF with weapons and mercenaries sent via African nations. The UAE and the RSF have repeatedly denied these allegations. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into all-out civil war. Rubio's comments are some of the most outspoken so far by the Trump administration about the war in Sudan and the actions of the RSF, but it is not clear how much impact they will have. A previous US-backed proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan has already been violated by the RSF, even though they agreed to it last week. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF after an 18-month siege, meaning they now control all of the cities in the vast western Darfur region. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee the city, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Non-Arab groups in the wider Darfur region are being systematically targeted by the RSF in what amounts to genocide, according to the US and humanitarian groups. At the talks near Niagara Falls on Wednesday, America's top diplomat said women and children had been targeted in acts of the most horrific kind by the RSF in el-Fasher. Rubio told reporters: ""They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind.  And it needs to end immediately. ""And we're going to do everything we can to bring it to an end, and we've encouraged partner nations to join us in this fight."" However, Rubio stopped short of publicly criticising Abu Dhabi, in spite of evidence that the Gulf state is the RSF's main arms supplier, presented in investigations by the international media that the UN has found credible. The Trump administration is working for an end to the war together with the UAE, as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who are allies of Sudan's military-led government, collectively known as the ""Quad"". ""I don't want to get into calling anybody out at a press conference today, because what we want is a good outcome here,"" Rubio said on Wednesday, but added pointedly: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" In September, the Quad jointly proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. In a statement on Thursday, the UAE expressed ""alarm at the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in El Fasher"". It went on to accuse the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusations the army has previously denied. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. The secretary of state rejected the paramilitary group's attempt to blame the killings on rogue elements, saying this was false and the attacks were systematic. Asked by the BBC about his assessment of the likely scale of atrocities, he said the US feared that thousands of people who had been expected to flee el-Fasher were either dead or too malnourished to move. He said the RSF, lacking its own arms manufacturing facilities, relied on outside support, and called for countries supplying weapons to stop. In response the RSF issued a lengthy statement denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"". The paramilitary group repeated denials that it does not receive support from external parties and said it did not accept attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. ""The party that has rejected all ceasefire initiatives and refused to engage in them is the army affiliated with the terrorist Islamic Movement,"" it said, ""while our forces responded in good faith officially announcing their approval. Yet to this day we have not received any reply from the US side. So, where is the other party and where is its response?"" The joint G7 statement also condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". To date, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes. The flow of weapons into the country during this two-year-long civil war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups."
China US,Elon Musk's $1tn pay deal approved by Tesla shareholders,2025-11-07T10:03:09.647Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyk6kvyxvzo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders. The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares. The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him. Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name. ""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" he said. ""Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,"" he added. The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include: He won't receive a salary under the agreed deal. But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough. Musk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an ""autonomous humanoid robot"" performing ""unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks."" Using the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future. He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would - and in future, in homes. ""Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,"" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X. ""His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet."" Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was ""almost comfortable"" allowing drivers to ""text and drive essentially."" US regulators are after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries. Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months. Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring. Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks ""another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business."" Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. It is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added. Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over ""the polarisation of [Musk's] persona"" which has ""demolished the value of the brand"". ""Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,"" he said. Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him ""Tesla's biggest asset"" in a note published after the vote. ""We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,"" Mr Ives added. Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he ""hit those milestones ahead of schedule"" in 2018. She said his political interests had created some ""polarisation"", but his pay package did not ""put any constraints on his activities"" outside of the company. Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did. But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk. Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision. The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting. In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts. A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk. Kathryn Hannon, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the new pay deal would give Musk ""increasing voting power over the company"", which he had long been requesting for a number of years. ""Elon Musk, whether you like him or not, he is a visionary in this space and I guess putting the correct governance and incentivisation structures around him to deliver this does align him, hopefully, with shareholders on that success journey."""
China US,"Mass killings probe in Sudan will hold culprits to account, vows UN",2025-11-14T17:24:51.089Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jd4elgwzo,"The UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher. ""Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,"" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher. The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies  ""fuelling and profiting"" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Speaking on Friday, Türk said: ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population."" The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army.

China US,The private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UK's Covid response,2025-11-20T00:12:50.970Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78zy20ydlmo,"It was the most momentous event in UK history since World War Two. As a new virus took hold, millions of us were told to stay at home and billions of pounds were spent propping up the country's economy. The Covid inquiry will publish its second set of findings on Thursday, looking in detail at the huge political choices made at the time - including how lockdowns were introduced, the closure of businesses and schools, and bringing in previously unthinkable social restrictions. ""Did the government serve the people well, or did it fail them?"" asked the lead counsel at the start of this part of the inquiry in 2023. Since then more than 7,000 documents have been made public from the time, including WhatsApp chats and emails, private diaries and confidential files. Here, BBC News has picked out some of the urgent messages and scribbled notes that shine a light on how critical decisions were taken in 2020. On 2 January 2020 , a service used by health workers to warn of emerging diseases. ""World Health Organization in touch with Beijing after mystery viral pneumonia outbreak,"" it says. ""Twenty-seven people - most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - treated in hospital."" The next day England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, sends the bulletin on to Peter Horby, a professor at Oxford University and chair of Nervtag, a group that advises the government on new viral threats. By the end of January, it's clear the health authorities in Wuhan have a major problem on their hands. The deputy ambassador to China, Christina Scott, comparing the situation to the outbreak of another virus - SARS - in 2003. ""Hubei province on lockdown; multiple cities have transport restrictions. Memory of SARS cover-up ensures residual distrust of government response,"" it says. ""They will do everything they can to quickly control this outbreak. But the challenge of doing so is substantial."" The virus spreads to Thailand and South Korea and then to Iran and northern Italy. At lunchtime on Saturday 7 March the UK's then prime minister, Boris Johnson, is ahead of the England vs Wales game at Twickenham. Days later, the Cheltenham horse racing festival goes ahead and Atletico Madrid fans are allowed to fly from Spain to Liverpool to watch their team play in the Champions League. The government's strategy, backed by its scientific advisers, is to try to contain early outbreaks by isolating those with the virus and tracing any contacts. The plan is then to move to a ""delay phase"" as full community transmission is established – using policies like home isolation advice for those with symptoms to ""flatten the curve"" of the pandemic so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed. But the virus is spreading much faster than expected and it‘s quickly becoming clear to some scientists that far stronger action will be needed. On Friday 13 March, two senior No 10 officials are sitting in a key meeting of scientific advisers in Whitehall. ""WE ARE NOT READY,"" . The other leans over and crosses out ""NOT READY"", replacing it with an expletive. That weekend, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is locked in a series of meetings with the PM and a handful of select staff as a new strategy takes shape. Grainy smartphone images show whiteboards in No 10 and . One graph suggests that, if the virus was allowed to run its course without any restrictions in place, then more than 100,000 people would die ""in [hospital] corridors"" in the coming wave. On Sunday 15 March, Cummings : ""FYI – [Patrick] Vallance [the chief scientific adviser] is on board with what will NEVER be discussed as Plan B."" ""[In a] nutshell: we move through the gears to [do] whatever we need to stop NHS collapse and buy time to increase capacity."" Over the following week, Covid rules across the UK are tightened. People are advised, but not legally required, to avoid all non-essential contact and work from home where possible. Then schools are closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas. But still there are concerns that even those measures are not strong enough. On Sunday 22 March, London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, . The next evening, in a televised address watched by 27 million people, the prime minister tells the public they must stay at home as he announces the first national lockdown. It will now be up to the inquiry to decide if making that call earlier could have saved lives and ultimately reduced the total time that people had to stay locked indoors. Over the next month some hospitals do come under severe pressure with intensive care units spilling into corridors and side rooms. Pre-planned or elective care is put on hold but at no point does the NHS have to turn away emergency patients. Covid infections, hospitalisations and deaths start to fall. But the cost of lockdown restrictions is huge: education is disrupted, loneliness and mental health problems get worse, and jobs and businesses are impacted. On 22 May, Johnson asking for a plan to ""start operation BOUNCEBACK"". That month some restrictions begin to be lifted – soon groups of six are able to meet outdoors and schools start a phased re-opening. In the summer, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak tries to boost the economy with his Eat Out to Help Out scheme - 50% off food and drinks for three days a week in August. The idea is well received by the hospitality industry but there are concerns about the health impact. On WhatsApp (with spelling mistakes), Hancock warns Simon Case, then the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, that it's - that’s those local authorities with the highest infection rates. In his evidence to the inquiry, saying a second wave ""happened in every other country in Europe"". But that tension – between controlling Covid and protecting the economy – becomes even more intense through the autumn. Many scientists advising the government want to see tighter rules. They campaign for a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown to try to drive down infections. At times the documents suggest the prime minister supports tougher restrictions, at others he appears determined to avoid another strict national lockdown at all costs. On WhatsApp – using an emoji of a broken trolley as he appears to swerve from one policy position to another. ""This government doesn't have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not to,"" writes Case, who is now the new cabinet secretary, to Cummings and Lee Cain, No 10 director of communications, on 14 October. ""We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this."" In his testimony to the inquiry, Case later says he regrets expressing his ""at-the-moment frustrations"" with Johnson, whom he ""barely knew"" at the time. In his evidence, Johnson defends his own leadership style, saying his views changed with the scientific evidence, and he often adopted certain positions because he wanted to hear the counter arguments. As the nights draw in that autumn, it becomes clear that existing restrictions in England - including a 10pm curfew and the so-called tiered system of local controls - are not going to be enough to control the virus. By the end of October, the prime minister's frustration is obvious in the long note he marked OFFICIAL/SENSITIVE. In tightly spaced handwriting, Johnson pens 22 detailed points over two A4 pages of the document. He approves of strengthening some local restrictions but bemoans the ""terrible cost"" and wonders ""for HOW LONG?"" ""Is NHS T&T [test and trace] actually achieving ANYTHING?"" he asks at one point. A week later, on 5 November 2020, England does enter its second national lockdown, this time lasting four weeks, although most schools remain open. By this point many decisions are being taken independently by the four nations of the UK. Both Wales and Northern Ireland put in place versions of a circuit breaker lockdown, while in Scotland stricter rules are imposed in the central belt. The plan is still to allow families and friends to meet up at Christmas. But by mid-December a new, more infectious variant of the virus is spreading and millions living in the south-east of England are told at short notice that Christmas mixing will be cancelled. In January 2021, a third and final full national lockdown follows across the UK, as the winter wave peaks and the NHS starts rolling out millions of doses of the first Covid vaccines. Five years on from those dramatic 12 months, the inquiry's findings are long-awaited, particularly by the 235,000 families who lost loved ones in the pandemic. The messages and documents highlighted here are just a snapshot - the report due later will run to around 800 pages. It will examine some of the key questions in much more detail: the timing of lockdowns, the impact of restrictions on the most vulnerable, and public confidence in the rules amid reports of partying in Downing Street and other alleged rule breaches. Groups representing thousands of bereaved families want individuals working in government at the time to be held to account for any pandemic failings. But - above all - they want the state to learn lessons from any mistakes and be better prepared if and when the next unknown virus arrives on our shores.

China US,Swap shops reducing waste grow in popularity ,2025-11-08T07:25:02.177Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6zg2qe40o,"A community group dedicated to reducing waste said the popularity of its ""swap shop"" events is increasing. Sustainable Devizes first held a Devizes Swap Shop in 2022 from a small stand in the town's market place, with a couple of tables of books and toys. The event, which is now held at least three times a year and is attended by hundreds of people, is taking place later at St James' Church. People are encouraged to donate unwanted toys, games, crafts, books, houseplants and school uniforms, and can take anything away for free in exchange. Helen Langford now volunteers at the swap shops after first using the service herself. ""One time, I found it quite moving because I remember a particular lady who had a few children with her and she was basically saying, 'I couldn't have got through Christmas without this', and I knew it was making a really big difference,"" she said. ""For me personally, I was driven by trying to be more eco-friendly and trying to spend less, waste less and see stuff used for its whole life, rather than just used for a  season and out the door."" The founder, Sam Drury Shore, said: ""The reason I love the swaps is the co-benefits they bring. ""Our initial motivation was very much about reducing waste, and trying to gently change people's mindsets around consumption. ""But with the cost of living crisis, we can really see that the swaps are a huge help to families - hopefully without it seeming patronising or stigmatising as our framing is 'you are helping by reducing waste', rather than 'you are being helped by being given free stuff'."" The Devizes Swap Shop is taking place at St James' Church from 10:00 GMT."
China US,Mysterious drones have been spotted at night at airports across Europe. How worried should we be?,2025-11-17T00:17:43.171Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkl3d6pegpo,"It's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens. This is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine. These are attack drones that explode on impact. Drones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield. Across western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of ""hybrid warfare"" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine. Recent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries. Now, there is talk that a ""drone wall"" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic? On 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports. Nato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions. This was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began. Which is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing. ""This momentum is really driven by these recent incursions,"" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank. Drones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space. On the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices. But these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall. Previously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September. So, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond? After all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: ""[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money."" Ukraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians. Then there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet. But there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war. That is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared. Sometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports. This includes a suspected drone incursion above Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. Unlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these ""civilian drones"" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships. Suspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility. Belgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions). There is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base? The UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones. Still, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants. The plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia. The wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea. It's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027. Not surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia. Katja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue. But she adds:  ""This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders."" Nonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic. Robert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some ""sort of impervious wall"", is, in his words, out of the question. Yet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try. ""For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,"" he says. ""The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable"", agrees Ms Bego. ""It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them."" Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones. ""You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets. ""You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill."" Hard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means. Russia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders. As for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters. ""You can have lasers which could be useful as well,"" he adds, ""but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be."" André Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once. As tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called ""hybrid"" or ""grey zone"" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them. These include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables. And yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority. The first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised. Meanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge. Mr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. ""You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres. ""And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap."" The question of finance is a complex one. ""It is a really difficult defence question,"" says Mr Tollast. ""Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well. ""So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people."" It will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets. Initially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it. ""Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion... ""The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets"". As for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, ""they can definitely achieve more protection by then"". While all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them. This all makes it something of a new arms race. ""The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,"" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology. ""It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust. ""The aggressor"", he concludes, ""will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through"". So are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow. ""It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,"" argues Ms Bego. ""And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this."" But any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory. Ever since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war. Building a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another."
China US,Tutoring a baby to make him an 'English gentleman' - Is it worth the money?,2025-11-10T08:38:50.561Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kljww1zdo,"When reading this advert, you would be forgiven for skimming over the words ""first steps"", as a turn of phrase. But, it could be the most significant part of this unique job advert, as it seeks to find a tutor for a one-year-old. Hundreds of applications have now been submitted since the anonymous family published their request for the £180k-a-year tutor, who has to be ""someone very special"". Over the last few weeks, the advert has gained attention across the media, with many questioning why? Adam Caller, CEO and founder of Tutors International, which is assisting the family in their search, said despite initial scepticism, he found the idea ""far sighted"", and ""progressive"". When he met the family, he said they appreciated the unusual nature of their request, and how young their son is. However, they explained that they ""didn't want to wait any longer"" to get a tutor, as they had waited until their older child was five, and by that stage ""cultural bias had already set in"". But what does the family mean by ""cultural bias""? It's ""everything"", Adam replied. ""The way you eat, the way you speak."" He said the older sibling had picked ""really subtle, non-verbal cues"" from the family, and had adopted their cultural ways. The family told Adam they did not want history to repeat itself with their new baby. The plan: , who must speak with received pronunciation, to influence the baby right from the beginning. ""A lot of the learning at the beginning here is kind of osmotic,"" said Adam. It's via this osmosis that the family are hoping the child will pick up the British traits they wish to instil. Adam said the tutor had to be somebody who went to ""the right kinds of schools - the same kinds of schools as the family aspire to send their son to"". ""The tutor just has to be the right kind of person, they'll be doing things they don't even know they're doing, just naturally,"" he said. The family told Adam the successful candidate should ideally also have knowledge of or interest in horse-riding, skiing, the arts and music so as to influence the child in a broad spectrum of interests. More than that though, he said the family wanted the tutor to enrol the child on a range of classes so the child would be ""pony-riding and picking up an instrument by the time they are around three years old"". In the family's minds, helping their son become a ""British gentleman"" will lead to success and open doors. ""For all the rights and wrongs of that, because it's definitely a class statement,"" he adds. But, despite all this tutelage in ""Britishness"", could the child pick up so-called cultural bias from the international family he lives with anyway? ""Yes"", said Adam. ""The family know this may not work, but they've just taken the view of, 'let's give it a go and let's go as early as we can', because the cost of it is not relevant,"" he said. There are some in the tutoring industry who share those concerns. Peter Cui, CEO and founder of Blue Education, which also offers private tutors, wrote that ""the process of becoming bicultural, or indeed, becoming oneself, is something that must be lived into, not engineered"". Peter wrote that he had moved from China to the UK at the age of seven, and had been raised knowing and living both cultures. He went on to study at Cambridge University. ""The idea that one individual can serve as a living vessel of Britishness, someone who can somehow transplant the qualities of a British gentleman on to a one-year-old child, strikes me as idealistic and unrealistic,"" he wrote. ""In my experience, having a quintessentially British tutor from infancy will not automatically produce the outcome they desire. ""I never had such a figure, and yet I have been fortunate enough to live many of the experiences they aspire for their son."" He added: ""The truth is, cultural identity cannot be imposed from the outside; it must be chosen, and it must come from within."" Of course, Britishness is something Adam hopes can be taught - and sold. ""I think the fact that the world holds us in this regard is something that we should be cherishing and taking advantage of at the same time,"" he said. ""I don't think that, as British people, we should be embarrassed by this,"" Adam said. ""I think we should be proud of it."" The market for buying Britishness isn't just helping Adam's tutoring business, it's given rise to businesses such as Laura Windsor's Etiquette Academy. Laura, like other ""etiquette experts"", can teach people - for a fee - how to take afternoon tea, dress and hold a conversation, ""like a British person"". ""Society has become so diluted and unrestrained, people now want to go back to the way it was,"" she said. The demand for etiquette training is mainly from international clients who wish to be able to interact at business meetings and functions, she said. But she also teaches groups of children too. Why? ""Because being a polite gentleman or gentlewoman is all about first impressions,"" she said. ""Being polite means you respect other people, you make them feel comfortable and important. When you make people feel important, you're liked, and that opens doors to incredible opportunities."" She says she teaches people how it's ""all in the details"": ""It's about opening doors, and saying 'please' and 'thank you', and thinking about the other person."" Laura's students are never usually as young as one, but starting that young is something the etiquette expert says can have benefits. ""Starting at one, they will grow up being a gentleman, and therefore it's not a question of 'tweaking', it's who they are. ""Whereas nowadays, people need to be tweaked a little bit, to be a little bit more aware of what they do,"" she said. Raising his children to be classically British - with all the etiquette trimmings - is not the priority for Daniel (not his real name). ""Far from leaning into English, British values, we wanted the total opposite. We are trying to go away from the UK system and the straitjacket of that,"" he said. Daniel is currently employing one of Adam's super-tutors to work with his three children around their school hours. Next year the tutor will accompany the whole family as they move abroad for work. For Daniel and his wife, it's about teaching emotional intelligence, and preparing their children for a world influenced by artificial intelligence. Neither believes this is possible without an external tutor. The current British school system ""isn't fit for purpose"", he said, adding that one private school in London, has now dropped most of the GCSE examination system and instead uses its own in-house system which involves more group work activities and project-based learning. ""If GCSEs aren't going to be recognised everywhere - and are not the gold standard - maybe we would be better leaning into a tutor where we get so much more out of it,"" Daniel said. ""Right here, right now, in the UK school system, if I look at the quality of teacher my kids would get at a private school versus these tutors, it's an absolute joke - there is a real discrepancy,"" he said. He added that he recognised hiring a high-end tutor was for ""those in a lucky financial situation"", but explained that since private school fees , he felt the cost of the private tutor had become comparable for three children. ""My kids could have one-20th of a very average person's attention in school, or they could have one-third of an absolutely exceptional person - it's an absolute no-brainer."""
China US,Where is The Celebrity Traitors castle and can I ride the train?,2025-11-07T08:54:27.414Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4njdj4kxw2o,"The winner of The Celebrity Traitors was unveiled in a dramatic finale on Thursday night. The hit BBC series' inaugural celebrity edition featured a line-up of contestants including comedian Stephen Fry, singer Paloma Faith and Olympian Tom Daley. Host Claudia Winkleman pitted a handful of secret traitors against faithfuls at Ardross Castle, a grand Highland property that is one of the reality TV show's biggest stars - including a challenge on the Strathspey Railway. The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century pile about 30 miles north of Inverness. It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland near the Easter Ross town of Alness. The property was built more than 170 years ago in a Scottish baronial style, a type of elaborate architecture featuring complex rooflines with turrets and fortress-like battlements. More than 200 years ago - long before the castle was built - the land at Ardross was owned by George Granville Leveson-Gower, the 1st Duke of Sutherland. He had a hunting lodge on the site where the castle stands today. The duke was a controversial figure in the Highland Clearances. In large parts of Sutherland, he had people cleared off land where they had lived for generations to make way for sheep farming and agricultural ""improvements"". Some families were moved to coastal villages, while others became emigrants and made difficult journeys to Canada to start new lives there. There is a statue of the duke on a hilltop north of Ardross. Known locally as The Mannie, and overlooking Golspie, it has been the target of vandalism and even attempts . Years later the estate at Ardross was bought by Sir Alexander Matheson. Matheson made his fortune . He was an MP and an instrumental figure in the building of railways in the Highlands. And he had the castle, so familiar to Traitors fans today, constructed. Ross and Cromarty Heritage Society says that from 1847, about 400 workers were involved in the property's construction. They built 30 rooms and laid out the castle's extensive grounds. According to Ardross Castle's website, Sir Alexander also improved estate workers' housing. After Sir Alexander's death, the country house and its estate was sold to businessman and philanthropist Charles William Dyson Perrins. His grandfather William Perrins, in partnership with John Wheeley Lea, created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce. The Perrins family was also involved in the production of Royal Worcester porcelain. Charles William Dyson Perrins joined the family business after four years serving in the Highland Light Infantry. He and his family were annual visitors to Ardross Castle. The Perrins' ownership came to an end in the 1930s and various parts of the estate was sold off. In 1983, the castle was bought by the McTaggart family and they still own it today. While not run as a hotel, the property is available as a wedding venue - its popularity undoubtedly boosted by its appearance in The Traitors. In 2023, Loukas Tsarmaklis, a director of Ardross Castle Enterprises, told they ""try to keep a low profile... but there is no chance now."" ""This has put us on the map and helped local B&Bs, tradesmen, taxi drivers, cleaners. It was a big operation for this part of the world,"" he added. The castle's owners politely declined to comment on the impact the show has had to BBC Scotland News, but internet searches for the castle have been on the rise. Ross and Cromarty Heritage Society said views of its page about Ardross increased significantly because of the US show. Strathspey Railway is a volunteer-run company that operates a 10-mile (16km) route between Aviemore and Broomhill, via Boat of Garten. The heritage railway's line is part of the former Inverness and Perth Junction Railway, later called the Highland, which linked Aviemore with Forres. It is one of only a handful of former lines to be preserved following rail closures in the 1960s. The company has a fleet of steam and diesel locomotives which are run and maintained by a mix of volunteers and a small number of paid staff. It has frequently been involved in restoration projects, . The Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 engine - No. 46464 - was one of five built in Crewe, Cheshire, in 1950. It spent most of its working life based at Dundee Tay Bridge Steam Shed 62B, operating on services in Angus and Fife. Last week, Strathspey Railway said it had received a £1m donation from a mystery American donor . The railway runs trips throughout the year and is now operating to a winter timetable, which includes a festive Elf Express. Joining Claudia Winkleman in the castle were . They included comedian Alan Carr, singer and broadcaster Charlotte Church and former England rugby player Joe Marler. Also, broadcaster Kate Garraway, presenter Jonathan Ross and content creator Niko Omilana. Among those from the world of acting were Mark Bonnar, Tamela Empson and Celia Imrie."
China US,A simple guide to what is happening in Sudan,2025-11-13T14:12:12.647Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjel2nn22z9o,"Sudan plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious struggle for power broke out between its army and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It has led to a famine and claims of a genocide in the western Darfur region - with fears for the residents of city of el-Fasher after it was recently captured by the RSF. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes in what the United Nations has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Here is what you need to know. It is the latest episode in bouts of tension that followed the 2019 ousting of long-serving President Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in a coup in 1989. There were huge street protests calling for an end to his near-three decade rule and the army mounted a coup to get rid of him. But civilians continued to campaign for the introduction of democracy. A joint military-civilian government was then established but that was overthrown in another coup in October 2021. The coup was staged by the two men at the centre of the current conflict: But then Gen Burhan and Gen Dagalo disagreed on the direction the country was going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule. The main sticking points were plans to incorporate the 100,000-strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the new force. The suspicions were that both generals wanted to hang on to their positions of power, unwilling to lose wealth and influence. Shooting between the two sides began on 15 April 2023 following days of tension as members of the RSF were redeployed around the country in a move that the army saw as a threat. It is disputed who fired the first shot but the fighting swiftly escalated, with the RSF seizing much of Khartoum until the army regained control of it almost two years later in March 2025. The RSF was formed in 2013 and , where they were accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the region's black African, non-Arab population. Since then, Gen Dagalo has built a powerful force that has intervened in conflicts in Yemen and Libya. He also controls some of Sudan's gold mines, and allegedly smuggles the metal to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The army accuses the UAE of backing the RSF, and carrying out drone strikes in Sudan. The oil-rich Gulf state denies the allegation. The army also accuses eastern Libyan strongman Gen Khalifa Haftar of supporting the RSF by helping it to smuggle weapons into Sudan, and sending fighters to bolster the RSF. In early June 2025, the RSF achieved a major victory when it took control of territory along Sudan's border with Libya and Egypt. This was followed by the capture of el-Fasher in late October, meaning it controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan. With the RSF's recent formation of a rival government, it is likely Sudan will split for a second time - South Sudan seceded in 2011, taking with it most of the country's oil fields. The military controls most of the north and the east. Its main backer is said to be Egypt, whose fortunes are intertwined with those of Sudan because they share a border and the waters of the River Nile. Gen Burhan has turned Port Sudan - which is on the Red Sea - into his headquarters, and that of his UN-recognised government. However, the city is not safe - the RSF launched a there in March. This was retaliation after the RSF suffered one of its biggest setbacks, when it lost control of Khartoum - including the Republican Palace - to the army in March. ""Khartoum is free, it's done,"" Gen Burhan declared, as he triumphantly returned to the city, though not permanently. by the time the RSF left, with government ministries, banks and towering office blocks stand blackened and burned. Hospitals and clinics were destroyed, hit by air strikes and artillery fire, sometimes with patients still inside. The international airport - which was a graveyard of smashed planes - re-opened in mid-October to domestic flights, though its official opening was delayed by a day because a RSF drone hit an area nearby. The army has also managed to win back near total control of the crucial state of Gezira. , forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee its main city of Wad Madani, which had become a refuge for those who had escaped conflict in other parts of the country. But el-Fasher, which was the last major urban centre in Darfur held by the army and its allies, . Over 18 months, the RSF laid siege to the city, causing hundreds of casualties, overwhelming hospitals and blocking food supplies. It recently stepped up it efforts by building an earthen wall around the city to trap residents and stop food from reaching people - and destroyed the nearby Zamzam displacement camp which had already been hit by famine. Many Darfuris believe the RSF and allied militias have waged a war aimed at transforming the ethnically mixed region into an Arab-dominated area. In March 2024, the UN children's agency, Unicef, gave harrowing accounts of armed men . Some children have tried to end their own lives as a result. In the same month, in Darfur against the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities. Thousands had been killed in el-Geneina city in a campaign of ethnic cleansing with the ""apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region"", it said. HRW added that the widespread killings raised the possibility that the RSF and their allies had ""the intent to destroy in whole or in part""  the Massalit people. As this could constitute a genocide, it appealed to international bodies and governments to carry out an investigation. fell short of concluding that a genocide was taking place. Instead, it found that that both the RSF and army had committed war crimes. However, the US determined in January this year that the RSF and allied militias have committed a genocide. ""The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys - even infants - on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,"" then-Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said. ""Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies. Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,"" he added. This led to the US imposing sanctions on Gen Dagalo, followed by . Sudan's government filed a case against the UAE in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of being complicit in the genocide by funding and arming the RSF. However, the ICJ refused to hear the case, saying that it had no jurisdiction over it. The UAE welcomed its ruling, with an official saying that the Gulf state . However, UN experts say allegations that the UAE is supporting the RSF are credible. The RSF also denies committing genocide, saying it was not involved in what it describes as a ""tribal conflict"" in Darfur. But the UN investigators said they had received testimony that RSF fighters taunted non-Arab women during sex attacks with racist slurs and saying they will force them to have ""Arab babies"". With reports of there are concerns about the fate of an estimated 250,000 people in the city, many from non-Arab communities. There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but they have failed. In early November, the RSF announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt. However, , accusing the RSF of not respecting ceasefires. UN health chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also lamented that there is less global interest in the conflict in Sudan, and other recent conflicts in Africa, compared to crises elsewhere in the world. ""I think race is in the play here,"" . The International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank has called diplomatic efforts to end the war ""lacklustre"", while Amnesty International has labelled the world's response ""woefully inadequate"". Humanitarian work has also been badly affected by the decision of the Trump administration to cut aid. The WFP says more than 24 million people in the country are facing acute food insecurity. Aid volunteers told the BBC that more than 1,100 - or almost 80% - of the , fuelling the perception that Sudan's conflict is the ""forgotten war"" of the world. There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of Sudan despite calls from human rights groups. The flow of weapons into the country has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of being the main provider of arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. As for the Sudanese Armed Forces, . All parties deny these allegations. In October 2025, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" At a later summit of G7 foreign ministers, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to the RSF. Sudan is in north-east Africa and is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million sq km (734,000 sq miles). It borders seven countries and the Red Sea. The River Nile also flows through it, making it a strategically important for foreign powers. The population of Sudan is predominantly Muslim and the country's official languages are Arabic and English. Even before the war started, Sudan was one of the poorest countries in the world - despite the fact that it is a gold-producing nation. Its 46 million people were living on an average annual income of $750 (£600) a head in 2022. The conflict has made things much worse. Last year, Sudan's finance minister said state revenues had shrunk by 80%."
China US,William puts flood-hit Welsh town in COP spotlight,2025-11-07T13:04:28.241Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4j8er4xjmo,"The Prince of Wales has put the plight of a flood-ravaged town in south Wales at the heart of his message to world leaders gathered in Brazil for the COP30 summit. Prince William said he was ""deeply moved"" by the resilience of the people in Pontypridd, whom he in February after devastating . ""One resident told me how the river that once brought life to the town had become a source of fear,"" he said, in a high-profile speech given in the city of Belem, in the heart of the Amazon. The prince called for ""courage, co-operation and unwavering commitment"" to tackle the climate crisis, warning of a ""critical tipping point"" ahead. ""We must ask ourselves, what legacy do we wish to leave?"" said Prince William, who was joined by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and  Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the annual climate summit. The prince warned humanity was edging towards the ""Earth's critical tipping points"", citing ""the melting of polar ice, the loss of the Amazon, the disruption of ocean currents"". ""These are not distant threats,"" he said. ""They are fast-approaching and will affect every one of us, no matter where we live."" In Pontypridd, earlier this year, the prince said he and the princess met ""families who had lost their homes, their possessions, and their sense of security"". ""Their resilience was deeply moving. ""It was also a powerful reminder that climate change is not a distant threat,"" he said. ""It is affecting lives across the UK, and across the world - from small towns to major cities, from coastal communities to inland regions. ""No corner of the globe will be unaffected."" Sir Keir spoke directly after Prince William, challenging climate sceptics with a promise to double-down on net zero, on the issue of climate change. The Prime Minister staunchly defended the UK government's clean energy agenda, but conceded that cross-party unity on science ""that is unequivocal"" has splintered, both in Britain and globally. Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit. After Thursday's speech, the prince posed for a picture with Brazil's president, Lula, and Sir Keir, laughing as they brought their hands together in a triple handshake, and walking off the stage in unison. The speech at COP30 was Prince William's highest-profile public address to date, speaking on behalf of the UK government and his father, King Charles, with whom he shared the contents of his address before his departure for Brazil. ""I grew up with my father – the King – talking about the power of nature and the importance of harmony in the natural world,"" he said. ""A subject he has championed for over five decades. ""It is a privilege to also represent him here today, as well as everyone else who has championed this cause, for so many years."" The prince also praised as ""visionary"" a Brazilian-led fund for rainforests – seen as key to the UN Cop30 climate summit, but which the British Government has said it will not currently invest in, ahead of the Budget later this month. Prince William's five-day trip to Brazil, his first to the country, included , on Wednesday ""When we unite behind shared purpose, we can scale and accelerate solutions that transcend borders,"" he told delegates at COP30. ""Solutions that give us hope, and fill us with optimism, for the future."" He went on to talk about one of the Earthshot Prize finalists, as he called for unity in the fight for climate change. ""Brazil's proposal for the Tropical Forests Forever fund is a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability. That is why it was an Earthshot Prize finalist this year. ""The initiative recognises that climate and nature must be addressed together – not in silos, but in synergy. ""The science is clear – we must go further if we are to secure a liveable future for all. And we must go together. ""The time for partnership, protection, and progress is now. ""We know what is at stake. We know what must be done. And we know that no country, no community, no individual can do it alone."""
China US,Asylum seekers will be banned from taking taxis for medical appointments,2025-11-29T13:27:54.541Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjn2y4eed5o,"Asylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced. It comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxis or minicabs, with one asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, . In response, the government into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September. Now the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around £15.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers. Earlier this year, found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used. On Friday, one driver told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said. Another taxi driver, who gave the name Steve, claimed firms would purposely increase the mileage on trips by dispatching drivers to another distant town to carry out short journeys. He told File on Four that on one occasion he was sent from Gatwick Airport to Reading - a round trip of about 110 miles (175km) and costing more than £100 - to take an asylum seeker from their hotel to a dentist appointment which was 1.5 miles away. Steve said that while working for a subcontractor he was sent from Gatwick to Southampton ""more than once"", and that he drove an average of 275 miles a day - half of which was without a passenger in his car. He claimed that some journeys were completely wasted. ""I'd be sitting there and [would be told] 'oh look don't worry, [the asylum seekers] don't wanna go' and they basically refused to move. It just logistically wasn't thought out very well and I think it was left open to abuse,"" he said. But Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this was now going to change. She said: ""I am ending the unrestricted use of taxis by asylum seekers for hospital appointments, authorising them only in the most exceptional circumstances. ""I will continue to root out waste as we close every single asylum hotel."" She said the government had inherited expensive Conservative contracts. Instead of taxis, ministers want asylum seekers to use alternatives like public transport. There will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy-related needs. These will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules. There are other circumstances in which taxis can be used - such as moving between accommodation - but ministers are reviewing the wider use of taxis for asylum seekers and want to extend the principle that they are only used in exceptional circumstances with support evidence. Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said the current use of taxis was ""symptomatic of an asylum system that allows private contractors to make vast profits at the expense of the taxpayer"". He added that: ""It is more a consequence of government incompetence and poor contract management than people in the asylum system exploiting it."" Mr Solomon called for an end to ""profiteering"" contracts and for more asylum seekers to be allowed to work ""so they can support themselves"". Ministers have pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the next election. They want to increase the use of alternative accommodation, such as large military sites. But figures earlier this week showed 36,273 people were still living in asylum hotels in the UK - an increase compared to June. There has also been criticism of the growing cost of running asylum accommodation, which has gone up significantly since the contracts were signed. When the home secretary was asked if the government was prepared to exercise break clauses in contracts with providers in a BBC interview earlier this year, Mahmood said she would explore all options. But doing so would mean alternative accommodation needs to be found. The government has also announced significant changes to overhaul the asylum system, with refugee status becoming temporary and the ending of guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers. The since it came to power but the chair of the home affairs select committee said that was only a start. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: ""The issue is that Labour can't get a grip on the illegal immigration crisis.

China US,How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor,2025-11-10T00:17:37.214Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yl88wd3lo,"You probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been the in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa, The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead. This American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. ""The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,"" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. ""This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market."" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. ""We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity"". Sepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. ""To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,"" she says. ""So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants."" Ms Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. ""There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,"" she says. ""You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc."" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative. One US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa is in South Africa's Gauteng province. ""It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,"" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa. However, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick. He argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough. ""Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,"" says Prof Branstetter. Going forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haihambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."
China US,China launches new aircraft carrier in naval race with the US,2025-11-07T08:00:25.247Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e0yx39g5o,"China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds. Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships. China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up. The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong. State media hailed the Fujian as a ""major milestone"" in the development of China's navy. The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian. The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea. State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: ""Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!"""
China US,Devastating toxic spill seen as test of whether African countries will stand up to China,2025-12-02T06:02:35.007Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nly288j4o,"Even before the dam collapsed, Lamec did not feel safe working at the copper mine. ""If our work protective gear gets damaged, it is not always replaced,"" he tells us. ""We have to take a risk and use it again."" He is talking to the BBC in a car on a quiet backroad near a village in northern Zambia, too nervous to speak to us in public or to use his real name, for fear that speaking to the press might cost him his livelihood. When he turned up for his shift one day in February, he tells us, he found that one of the dams at the Chinese-owned mine had been closed. The tailings dam - used to store toxic by-products from the copper mining process, including heavy metals like arsenic, mercury and lead - had collapsed into a tributary connected to the Kafue, Zambia's longest river and a major drinking water source. At least 50,000 tonnes of acidic debris spilled out into the surrounding waterways and farmland, according to the government. Some environmentalists, however, claim as much as 1.5 million tonnes was spilled, with one expert saying a full clean-up could take longer than a decade. The spill has killed the fish around the towns of Chambishi and Kitwe, made the water undrinkable and destroyed crops, farmers have told the BBC. There are fears that, now the rainy season has started, heavy metals still sitting in the mud will further infiltrate the land and waterways, causing a second wave of pollution. Toxic metals that can cause kidney damage and cancers, as well as gastric and intestinal issues, could be carried downstream to the capital, Lusaka, says Dr Mweene Himwiinga, a senior lecturer at Zambia's Copperbelt University. The Chinese embassy in Lusaka disputes the scale of the damage and told the BBC it welcomed the establishment of an independent investigation into the incident. The Zambian government, it said, had reported that the pollution was contained to a confined area, water acidity levels had returned to normal limits and that ongoing checks showed no lasting public-health risks. Lamec, like his country Zambia, finds himself in a difficult position. The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse. More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment. In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households. They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement. The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories. ""All eyes are on this case,"" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. ""Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved."" People found it hard to believe at first ""because something of this scale had not happened before,"" he adds. The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining. Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China. But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba. ""There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,"" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. ""We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue."" Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese. Between 2000 and 2023, 49 African countries are believed to have signed $182.3bn (£139.4bn) worth of loans with Chinese lenders. In Copperbelt Province, Lamec tells us he was really broken by the spill affecting his family. ""We were told that the waterways now had acid in them, and that we were not supposed to use the water."" For two weeks after the spill, Lamec says he and his family weren't allowed to use the local water until it had been sprayed with lime to help reduce the acidity. He took the job at the dam because, he says, he has no other way to make a living, but now feels conflicted about working there. Copper mining has been the economic backbone of this region for more than a century. The metal makes up 70% of Zambia's exports and accounts for 15% of its GDP. The industry is set to grow further, with plans to more than triple production in Zambia by 2031, according to plans laid out by the government last year. In the village of Twalima, it has been a struggle to grow anything since the spill, say farmers Abigail Namtowe, 28, and Frederick Bwalya, 72. Farming was the main source of food and income for Ms Namtowe's family, and her six year-old daughter is now very hungry and malnourished, she told us. ""I've tried to grow my maize, I've tried everything so the hunger won't kill my child, but it's too much."" Mr Bwalya has lived in Twalima for 33 years. Strong and energetic, we meet him working on his farm which he tends to daily. ""Farming is not going well because the soil is not clean,"" he says. He also describes a severe pain in his leg which won't go away and makes it difficult for him to move. ""The doctor says the contaminated water could be causing this,"" he adds. Sino Metals has promised to build a borehole away from the contaminated stream at the bottom of his farm, he says, but that hasn't happened yet. He believes that water deeper underground would be safer. The stream used to be teeming with fish, say Mr Bwalya and his neighbours, adding that since the spill, there haven't been any. The BBC asked Sino Metals about the alleged promise to build boreholes on the land of affected farmers. We also put Lamec's allegations that he does not feel safe working at the company, but the firm did not respond. Fifty kilometres (31 miles) away from Frederick Bwalya's village, in Kamwatimpa, we saw schoolchildren swimming in a tributary of the Kafue river. Some mothers - still worried about the pollution - said they had told their children not to go into the water. But the government says it sampled 21 sites across Copperbelt Province in September, and that the concentrations of heavy metals were within national safe limits. Now the rainy season has taken hold, the power to stop a second wave of pollution seeping into the soil, and carrying heavy metals down the river to the rest of the country, is in the hands of the government and Sino Metals. The clean-up has been delayed by issues between the consultants hired to assess the damage and Sino Metals, Dr Chibamba told the BBC, when asked why some of this work hadn't been done earlier. Meanwhile, Dr Himwiinga warns that failure to deal with the situation ""may be catastrophic"". ""They [the heavy metals] could be there for years, and their effects could be felt for a very long period of time, by farmers... who rely on that water to irrigate their crops,"" she says. ""According to research carried out by Copperbelt University, this could go on for even over 10 years, unless remediation efforts are put in place."" The Zambian government says it is aware of this and has instructed Sino Metals to put mitigations in place to stop secondary pollution - including planting trees, to bring down levels of pollution in the air and soil, as well as spreading lime to reduce acidity. These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities. Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment. Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company. One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments. But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries. ""The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,"" says Prof Chan. ""The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans."" Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa. African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says. ""It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world."" African governments are ""not always getting it right"", he says, however ""this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make."" For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was ""grossly unfair"" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial. ""Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,"" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says. ""It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa."""
China US,Louvre to hike ticket prices for most non-EU tourists by 45%,2025-11-28T08:59:32.121Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd4llgrego,"Ticket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday. From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery. The museum's security and management have faced criticism since , when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes. An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure. From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum. Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC. The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added. The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum. There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026. Macron also said the to deal with overcrowding. Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo. The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros. Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics . The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration."
China US,Shein and Temu face calls for investigation over claims of stealing US designs,2025-12-02T09:52:28.694Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lvzeyk21vo,"Online retailers Shein and Temu are facing increased pressure in the US after two senior politicians pushed for investigations, including into claims of forced labour and intellectual property (IP) theft. In Texas, the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a probe into allegations of forced labour and the use of unsafe materials at Shein. At a national level, Senator Tom Cotton called for a federal investigation into possible IP theft at both Shein and Temu, which he labelled ""Communist Chinese"" platforms. Shein said it took concerns raised about its business practices seriously. Temu did not immediately respond for comment. Shein said in a statement that it would co-operate with the investigation and that it welcomed ""constructive engagement"" with Paxton. It said in response to Cotton's letter that the company continues to invest in protecting the rights of designers worldwide. ""We are constantly improving our internal processes to better protect creators,"" said Shein. The retailer is headquartered in Singapore but most of the goods sold on its platform are made in China, where it was founded. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, Cotton - senior Republican from Arkansas - said that millions of packages from China now sit in US warehouses after Washington changed its rules on low-cost shipments in August. , a global tariff exemption widely used by buyers of low-cost goods. The change subjected shipments to levies and stricter customs checks. The new regulations gives the Department of Justice and Homeland Security a ""golden opportunity"" to act, said Cotton, a key ally of Trump and a vocal critic of China. Designers and small American brands have accused Shein of systematically copying their original creations, often just days after launch, and selling them at a fraction of the price, he said. Cotton also accused Temu of carrying ""sophisticated and deceptive fakes"" on its platform, which has hundreds of millions of users. Cotton cited a which found a significant proportion of items that its researchers bought on Shein and Temu were likely counterfeits. Separately, Paxton from Texas said that numerous reports have raised serious concerns about Shein's alleged reliance on forced labour, and claims of the use of unsafe materials and deceptive marketing. The brand has been under scrutiny over the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business and the on its site. The Republican lawyer said the investigation will assess if Shein's practices violate Texas law by allegedly using hazardous materials and if it has misled consumers about ethical sourcing. The probe will also examine Shein's data collection practices, he added. ""I will not allow cheap, dangerous, foreign goods to flood America and jeopardise our health,"" said Paxton online. Shein also faces calls by the European Union to curb sales of childlike sex dolls and weapons on its third-party marketplace place after . Temu is also being investigated in France over the spread of harmful content accessible to young people. Shein is not the only firm under fire by Paxton, who, like Cotton, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. He and deceiving parents about the dangers that the platform is said to pose to young gamers. Roblox has denied the claims, which it said are based on ""misrepresentations"" of its online gaming platform."

Bristol-based Aardman Studios, famed for its stop-motion and clay modelling animation, was founded by school friends David Sproxton and Peter Lord. The ""Cracking Exhibition Gromit: 50 Years of Aardman in Bristol"" is due to take over the M Shed next summer, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, iconic characters and a celebration of the studio's ""deep-rooted connection"" to the city Ngaio Harding-Hill, from Aardman, said: ""2026 is such an important year for Aardman and the anniversary would never have been complete without a celebration in our home city."" ""The programme of experiences with M Shed and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery will be a real highlight celebrating the importance of Bristol, its people and creative connection to the studio over the last 50 years,"" he added. As part of the collaboration, ""Aardman treasures"" will also be hidden throughout Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Bristol Museums head of culture, Philip Walker, said they were ""absolutely delighted"" to be working with Aardman on this exciting collaboration. ""It's a brilliant celebration of Bristol's creative spirit and a tribute to the imagination and humour that Aardman has shared with the world for half a century,"" he said. ""We can't wait to showcase 50 years of clay, creativity, and cracking adventures."" The first Wallace And Gromit film was 1989's A Grand Day Out, which was followed by The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit and A Matter Of Loaf And Death. The studio's most recent film Vengeance Most Fowl, which saw the return of evil penguin Feathers McGraw, picked up two gongs at the Baftas awards ceremony and was also nominated for an Oscar."
China US,'I am devastated': Hong Kong residents in disbelief after fire destroys blocks of flats,2025-11-27T15:03:14.208Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjnlx1g6yo,"""When you get closer the heat rises and you can feel it and the smoke is really heavy."" Student Thomas Liu was one of many people drawn to the scene of a deadly fire that tore through much of the eight-block Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district. At least 83 people have died so far in the devastating blaze that began on Wednesday, and with hundreds still missing, this number is expected to rise. The cause is not yet known, but three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to flammable materials, including mesh and plastic sheets, that may have allowed the fire to spread quickly. ""It's a disaster,"" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. ""Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,"" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. The fire was gradually being contained but officials said they did not know when it would be fully extinguished. Flames could be seen coming from individual apartments as many people watched on in silence. One woman said her friends live inside the building and she was waiting to hear if they managed to get out. Harry Cheung, who has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for more than 40 years, told Reuters he heard ""a very loud noise"" and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. ""I immediately went back to pack up my things,"" the 66-year-old resident said. ""I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight because I probably won't be able to go back home."" A woman in her sixties, whose surname is Kam and who lives in the adjacent Kwong Fuk Estate, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that several of her friends living in Wang Fuk Court had been accounted for - but not all. One friend has daily afternoon naps and may have been sleeping when the fire broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT), Ms Kam said, adding that the woman's daughters have not yet been able to contact her. Another resident, 65-year-old Jason Kong, told Reuters that a neighbour called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. ""I am devastated. There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do. I hope the government can help us to settle down after this."" An elderly woman who lives in one of the affected blocks told the BBC she was not at home when the fire broke out but that she was worried about her apartment because it was not insured. ""I'm very upset that I have no home to go to now,"" she said. While the cause of the fire that engulfed the multiple high-rise blocks was unknown, police say a mesh material and plastic sheets were found outside the buildings - both of which are not believed to be fireproof. Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows. These materials may have caused the fire to spread more quickly, said police. Some people have expressed anger that such a massive fire could have happened and criticised the response. ""When there's a wildfire, they will deploy helicopters and drop water bombs, but why is there no such deployment and how can they leave other buildings burning?"" Ms Poon, another resident of Wang Fuk Court, who is in her sixties, asked. ""The community is so close to the fire station and we thought the fire could be put out soon, but now the fire has spread. I'm so disappointed,"" she told the SCMP. Ms Poon noted that she had been given no instructions from the government on where to seek help. The BBC spoke to some Tai Po residents who had brought supplies to the victims and affected residents - including dozens of blankets and heat packs. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said government departments were assisting residents affected by the fire. When asked about their feelings about the fire, the residents said ""the government is incompetent"" and that they were ""immensely heartbroken"". ""We don't want to see any more casualties,"" said one."
China US,COP30: Five key takeaways from a deeply divisive climate summit ,2025-11-23T00:10:18.355Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp84m16mdm1o,"In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive. Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated. The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change. Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the ""COP of truth"". The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted. And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting. Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible. So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP. The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations. Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that. While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return. Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas. To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion. It made matters worse. Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy. The EU were given short shrift by major producers. ""We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,"" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer. Ouch! Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse. Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP. These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain. They are the richest group of nations still in the but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour. While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of. The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft. The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the ""tripling"" word stayed in the text. So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in. ""Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,"" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics. ""This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union."" The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front. The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself. Two often heard positions: How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words? How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks? The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore. ""We can't discard it entirely,"" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News. ""But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far."" Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people. It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore. Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an ""implementation cop"" and put a lot of focus on the ""energy agenda"". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant. COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance. For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an ""orchestrated"" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G. 'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking. The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it. They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - ""unilateral"" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive. The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad. If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves. Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials. The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization. The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways. US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here. Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals. And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels. ""China kept a low political profile,"" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society. ""And they focussed on making money in the real world."" ""Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position."" to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

China US,Sixth-tier club contemplates second doc series,2025-11-23T12:32:40.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx5j096pxo,"A sixth-tier football club's owner says he is ""very close now to agreeing on series two"" of a documentary about his Sussex team. Eastbourne Borough Football Club has released the seven-episode Owning Eastbourne series on its YouTube channel. Cameras followed the club through the 2024-25 season, when the team lost in the National League South play-off semi-finals to Maidstone United. The club's owner Simon Leslie claims the first series of the documentary has ""had some really good interest"" from broadcasters since its release. It was broadcast on ReachTV, a channel shown in US airports, and the club is close to a deal to show the programme in China, according to Mr Leslie. The club owner told the BBC the documentary ""gives us an opportunity to share with people who want to get involved in what we're doing"". ""It's a very expensive business owning a football club,"" he said. ""I've had very broad shoulders for nearly three years and I need people to come in and support me, and help me, and be part of this journey."" He said viewers get ""a full, unfiltered view of behind the scenes, in the changing room, in the boardroom of what it's like in non-league football"". ""What's been really great over the last couple days is some of the comments have been incredibly positive,"" Mr Leslie said. ""There have been some less so comments as well, but it is like nothing else."" So far this season, Eastbourne have struggled in the National League South and currently find themselves in the relegation zone. Matt Gray, who was appointed in the summer, was sacked by the club in October and replaced by Tommy Widdrington for his second spell as manager of the club. Mr Leslie said the season so far had been ""a rollercoaster arc of emotions"" but he felt the team was ""on the up""."
China US,Dutch government suspends intervention into chipmaker Nexperia,2025-11-19T15:53:52.309Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p7j83rn1o,"The Dutch government has suspended its intervention at Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, following talks with China. The Hague over ""serious governance shortcomings"" and concerns over the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods. In response, Beijing blocked exports of the firm's chips. However, on Wednesday the Dutch government said it would halt its original decision following ""constructive talks"" with Beijing. China said it welcomed the move, adding it was a ""first step in the right direction towards a proper resolution"". Nexperia is a major supplier of basic computer chips to the car industry, and shortages have threatened global supply chains. A shortage of computer chips used in various electronic goods and cars would hugely impact the ability of manufacturers to make their products. The decision by the Dutch government will ease tensions between the European Union and China, which have been mounting in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. Vincent Karremans, economic affairs minister, said that he considered it right to suspend action, made under the Goods Availability Act, ahead of further talks with the Chinese government. ""We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement. The Dutch government said it originally invoked the Act following concerns ""from actions attributed to the now-suspended CEO, involving the improper transfer of product assets, funds, technology, and knowledge to a foreign entity"". ""These actions ran counter to the interests of the company, its shareholders, and Dutch and European strategic autonomy and security of supply,"" it said. In October, a Dutch court ordered the removal of ex-Nexperia CEO and Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng, citing alleged mismanagement. The Dutch government added that its decision had aimed to prevent a situation in which chips could become unavailable in an emergency. In December last year, the US government placed Wingtech, which owns Nexperia, on its so-called ""entity list"", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. Following the Dutch government's reversal, the Beijing acknowledged the move but said it was ""still a step away from addressing the root cause of the global semiconductor supply chain turmoil and chaos"". ""Furthermore, the erroneous ruling by the corporate court, spearheaded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, to strip Wingtech of its control over Nexperia remains a key obstacle to resolving the issue,"" it added. Wingtech has said it will fight the decision. Following the latest move, a spokesperson for Wingtch said the company ""strongly"" rejected the allegations against its chief executive. ""To date, no proof has been provided,"" it added. ""If the Dutch government is sincere about solving the problem, the Ministry should now file a letter with the Enterprise Chamber, explicitly withdrawing its support for the proceedings. ""These proceedings form a threat to the continuity of Nexperia B.V. and therefore for the economic security of the Netherlands and Europe - which is the exact same argument the Dutch government made previously in support of judicial intervention."""
China US,Strange pillar of light linked to Chinese rocket,2025-12-06T12:02:15.539Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98ze8jx7o,"A glowing streak spotted in the sky on Thursday morning was most likely caused by a Chinese rocket, experts say. Witnesses reported a bright, linear trail visible around dawn and dusk from several locations. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the US, said: ""It was definitely the Chinese Zhuque-3 rocket making its first test flight. ""It passed over the UK and northern Europe at around 05:00 GMT at the end of its first orbit, following launch from China at 04:02 GMT. Chinese upper stages have been previously observed to make long, linear propellant-dump trails."" Ellie Jarvis, from Clovelly, said: ""I've never seen anything like it. At first, I wondered whether it might be something like an aurora or a natural phenomenon - like a light pillar. ""I tried to see whether there was something shining a beam of light from across the bay, or perhaps from a ship - but that didn't  seem likely as the light seemed to be so high in the sky."" A jet contrail was also considered but dismissed because the trail appeared too widespread. Similar vertical light effects, known as light pillars, can sometimes form when high-altitude ice crystals reflect low-angle sunlight, creating unusual atmospheric displays."
China US,What we know about the Hong Kong apartment fires,2025-11-28T09:47:59.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxe9r7wjgro,"Hong Kong's deadliest fire in more than 60 years ripped through a high-rise public housing complex in the city's north-east this week, killing at least 128 people. Dozens more remain missing, with 79 people confirmed injured and and 89 bodies yet to be identified. Now, as the last flames are extinguished and the high-rise blocks smoulder against the city's urban skyline, attention has turned to the cause of the deadly fire, and the factors that allowed it to so rapidly spread. Many Hong Kongers have described it as a ""man-made disaster"". Authorities have attributed the ferocity of the blaze to Styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks - while also noting that fire alarms in all eight housing blocks were found to be not working effectively. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire, according to local media reports, and an investigation has been launched. What initially caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far. The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT). Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, each 31 storeys high. Seven have been affected by the fire, Tai Po district councillor Mui Siu-fung told BBC Chinese. Built in 1983, the tower blocks were undergoing renovations when the fire broke out. Tai Po is a residential district in the northern part of Hong Kong, near the city of Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland. The complex provides 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of the people who lived in the Wang Fuk Court housing complex are at least 65, or older, according to the latest census. Some of them have lived in the subsidised public housing estate since it was built. The cause of the fire is unknown, but Hong Kong Security Chief Tang Ping-Keung on Friday attributed its rapid spread to styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks. A preliminary investigation previously found that the blaze had escalated unusually fast, and police had revealed that a mesh material and plastic sheets - both of which are believed to not be fireproof - was found on the outside of the buildings. Police have arrested three men aged between 52 and 68 on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the deadly blaze. Two of them are directors of a construction firm while the other is an engineering consultant. A police spokesperson on Thursday said investigators were looking into the alleged actions, or failure to act, of the firm's top officials. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" said the spokesperson. Authorities on Friday further noted that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working effectively - confirming prior reports from some residents who said they did not sound when the blaze broke out. This was Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years. Within 40 minutes of first being reported it was declared a level four alarm - but it was raised to a level five, the highest in severity, about three and a half hours later. Local media had earlier reported that explosions could be heard inside the building and fire hoses could not easily reach the higher levels. The ferocity of the heat had prevented firefighters from entering the buildings. Officials told reporters on Friday that even after the fire had been put out, some sections of the buildings' remained above 200C (392F). The city's fire department on Thursday said that the combination of high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments made rescue operations difficult Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have an average living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out. Hundreds were evacuated to temporary shelters, and some were allocated emergency housing units. More than 2,311 firefighters took part in rescue operations, with 12 sustaining injuries during the response. Authorities said 391 fire engines were also mobilised and 188 ambulances dispatched. Among the dead is firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, who was with the service at Sha Tin Fire Station for nine years. The fire service says it lost contact with him at 15:30 local time, and about half an hour later, found that he had collapsed. He was taken to hospital but declared dead shortly after. ""I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,"" said Andy Yeung, director of the fire service. One resident, Mr Chung, told the BBC he got a panicked phone call on Wednesday afternoon from his wife saying she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Mr Chung said he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. to accommodate residents who were evacuated, the government said. The South China Morning Post reported that one of them - at Tung Cheong Street Sports Centre - was full, and residents were being directed to other shelters. Another, the Kwong Fuk Community Hall, which is just over the road from the housing estate, was deemed unsafe. Evacuees were moved to another shelter, further away. BBC Chinese reporter Gemini Cheng saw elderly residents, some using walking sticks or wheelchairs, arriving at some of the shelters. At least 900 people are taking shelter in such temporary facilities, news agency AFP reports, quoting Lee. Six schools in Tai Po will remain closed on Thursday, the Education Bureau announced, . An emergency monitoring and support centre is in operation to manage the impact of the fire, security secretary Tang Ping-keung said in a statement. A hotline for the public to ask about casualties has been set up by Hong Kong police. The tower blocks at Wang Fuk Court are covered in bamboo scaffolding and green construction netting, right up to the rooftops, because they are undergoing renovations. As mentioned earlier, authorities have attributed the quick spread of the fire to materials used in the renovation, such as mesh netting, plastic sheeting and styrofoam. It's still unclear how the fire began, but no matter its cause, proper netting on the buildings' exterior would have been key to preventing its spread, Jason Poon, chairman of construction NGO Chinat Monitor, told news outlet Initium Media. Substandard netting could cause the fire to spread rapidly, he added. Another engineer told Initium Media he believes that the vast majority of mesh netting used in construction across Hong Kong is not made of fire-retardant material. Cardboard, debris and paint thinner is also often found on the scaffolding, which along with dry weather could hasten the spread of fire, the engineer said. One fire safety expert the BBC spoke to said the bamboo scaffolding - a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. Authorities have not mentioned scaffolding as having caused or fuelled the rapid spread of the fire. Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong, although reports said these were caused by falls and other safety failures, rather than fires. Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were ""relatively old"" - they were built in the 1980s - so ""the glass windows are not that fire resilient"". ""The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane... [which makes it] very easy to be broken by the flames and the flames can then penetrate through the facade."""
China US,'Hang in there': Agonising wait for the missing after Hong Kong blaze,2025-11-28T07:11:58.245Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9y0pjzmdro,"""Hang in there."" Those were the last words Mr Chung said to his wife after a huge 's Tai Po district. It was around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday when he got her panicked phone call. She said she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Firefighters in the Chinese territory took nearly 24 hours to tame the blaze that tore through seven tower blocks, including theirs, claiming at least 128 lives so far. Nearly 300 people are still unaccounted for - Mr Chung's wife is among the many missing. The BBC spoke to several residents who were not at home or managed to escape in time. Some, like Mr Chung, have waited outside the burning buildings, hoping against hope. There was no alarm warning them of danger, all of them told the BBC. Mr Chung, 45, and his brother, spent Wednesday night on the street asking the firefighters dozens of times for updates - but they couldn't give them any. Throughout, he said, he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. The Chungs moved in a decade ago to Wang Cheong House – the first of the seven tower blocks at Tai Po to go up in flames. When the fire started, Mr Chung says, the smoke on the 23rd floor, where they lived, turned so thick within just 10 minutes, that his wife couldn't find her way out. The cause of the fire is still unclear, but authorities believe renovations using flammable material and scaffolding helped spread what has now become the deadliest blaze in Hong Kong in six decades. It engulfed seven of the eight buildings - comprising 1,800 units - in Wang Fuk Court, a subsidised housing estate built in 1983 to the north of Hong Kong Island, where the city's wealthy live. Nearly 40% of Wang Fuk Court's residents are aged 65 or above, according to the 2021 census. It's partly why it's feared so many residents were trapped - because they are older and less likely to have made it out quickly. Ms Fung, 40, has not been able to find her mother yet. She and her parents moved to the estate only last year - for its views of the ocean. Her father and she were at work when the fire started. Ms Fung received a call from her neighbour, who said she was hiding with Ms Fung's mother inside a toilet. But they lost contact at midnight on Wednesday. All the same, she is holding on to hope: ""We will think about our next steps after my mum comes out."" She sought help from police, but she says she was furious when they called her back to ask if it was possible her mother could have somehow escaped. She demanded to know how that was possible: ""You know much better than us how badly burnt Wang Cheong House is!"" On social media, posts about missing elderly relatives, children and pets have been circulating endlessly. A desperate mother wrote: ""I still can't find my baby girl. It's nearly 30 hours and there has been no updates from the fire service…"" In a later post, she said: ""I am afraid there is no hope."" The devastation has spotlighted the expensive and controversial renovations at Wang Fuk Court, which cost about HK$330M ($42.2M; £32.1M), with each household having to pay between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000. Many residents had opposed the project because of the costs but it went ahead. Authorities have now arrested three executives from the construction firm, citing ""gross negligence"".  Police say the mesh and plastic sheets used on the scaffolding were substandard, and that windows were wrapped in highly flammable styrofoam. Grandma Chan, a long-time resident, says she had been scared since the renovation began last year, because of its scale and she had occasionally noticed a burning smell. ""Will anything happen if I stay home?"" she once asked her daughter. The 72-year-old was alone at home when the fire started but she only found out about it when her daughter, who was travelling in South Korea, called. She says she made it out alive because her daughter told her to flee. It was the same for 82-year-old Grandma Wu. When the fire broke out, she was playing mahjong, a popular game, with her neighbours. They were warned not by an alarm, but by their husbands calling them. But she said they continued the game because there were three buildings between theirs and Wang Cheong House, where the fire broke out. Then came a second call, saying the fire had reached their building. The women immediately took the lift and reached the ground floor. Surrounded by the smell of burning buildings, Grandma Wu looked up to find that seven of eight buildings within the complex were in flames. Although she was safe, she stayed outside, with her helper, overnight. She says her son wanted to take her to his home but she refused. ""I have been living in this flat for 42 years,"" she says. ""I told my son not to come, and I would not go anywhere. I have to sit here and watch how this goes. My heart will only be at peace after the fire is extinguished."" When that happens, a new battle begins for many residents who have poured a life's worth of savings into buying these homes. Kyle Ho, 32, moved into the complex with his retired parents three years ago. Despite the subsidised price, they needed a mortgage to afford a home at Wang Fuk Court. Now, they don't know what comes next. The Hong Kong government has announced cash relief of HK$10,000 for displaced families, and a HK$300m assistance fund. That could be some relief for Mr Ho. ""The worst-case scenario is that we have lost our flat,"" he says. ""But the most important thing is that all of us are safe. We are luckier than many other families."" For those like Mr Chung, the wait continues as authorities insist they have not ruled out rescuing people. ""We haven't given up,"" they said earlier on Thursday. Mr Chung, too, is determined to find his wife. ""I want to rescue her - whether she's alive or gone."""
China US,Cats became our companions much later than you think,2025-11-27T20:02:21.954Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8dvdp9gn7o,"In true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place. A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. ""They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,"" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford. ""That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago."" All modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat. How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists. To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats. The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa. ""Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,"" said Prof Larson. This fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies. Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought. They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China. Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica. And in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene. These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years. The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially ""commensal"" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. ""Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,"" she said. Leopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia. Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s. The research is published in the journal, and in ."
China US,"Graduate jobs under threat from AI, PwC boss says",2025-11-21T02:34:57.601Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm272510e6jo,"The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) may eventually lead to fewer entry-level graduates being hired, the boss of accountancy giant PwC has told the BBC. However, global chairman Mohamed Kande said AI was not behind recent job cuts at the firm, adding that the company actually needed to hire hundreds of new AI engineers but was struggling to find them. But some observers say the technology itself threatens thousands of junior jobs across the professional services industry. Speaking on the sidelines of a business summit in Singapore, Mr Kande also said big changes in the global economy, such as US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, had been good for the firm's consulting business. He also addressed the company's suspension in China last year over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande, promising that the same mistakes ""would not happen again"". Headquartered in London, PwC is one of the Big Four accountancy firms. It provides a range of services, such as financial auditing, consulting and tax advice for business clients around the world. According to Mr Kande, advising them on how to integrate AI into their operations will be at the heart of the firm's future business strategy, even as the rapidly advancing technology affects its own hiring plans. Firms who would have previously hired PwC consultants to sift through data and documents may now use AI models instead, turning weeks of costly work into mere minutes. Every year, the company hires thousands of new graduates in entry-level positions - including 1,300 in the UK and 3,200 in the US last year - but it recently dropped long-term plans to continue increasing its headcount. In 2021, PwC said it wanted to hire 100,000 people over the course of five years - but Mr Kande said this would no longer be possible. ""When we made the plans to hire that many people, the world looked very, very different,"" he said. ""Now we have artificial intelligence. We want to hire, but I don't know if it's going to be the same level of people that we hire - it will be a different set of people."" Last year, PwC cut more than 5,600 roles across its worldwide operation. The boss of the company's UK business has previously spoken about reducing graduate recruitment, admitting that AI was ""certainly reshaping roles"". At a global level, however, Mr Kande insisted that the AI boom was an ""exciting time"" for creating new jobs. ""We are looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers today to help us drive our AI agenda, but we just cannot find them,"" he said. Businesses around the world may be facing challenges adapting to AI, but in the meantime PwC appears to have benefited from the broader uncertainty in the global economy, largely fuelled by President Trump's extensive use of tariffs. ""We are receiving a lot of calls from many companies around the world asking how to navigate the current environment,"" said Mr Kande. ""It's been good for us. We need to remain relevant to our clients and we have to be in these discussions, which we are."" However, the company took a huge reputational blow last year, when over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande. The firm went bust after amassing debts of more than $300bn (£230bn) and has been at the centre of a ruinous housing crisis that continues to damage lives and livelihoods in China. The country's Securities Regulatory Commission found that PwC, as the auditor, had ""covered up and even condoned"" financial fraud at Evergrande. Mr Kande, whose tenure as global chairman began after Evergrande went bankrupt, said PwC no longer faced any restrictions in China. ""Let me tell you - we changed many of our people, implemented new quality management systems and introduced new governance systems,"" he said. ""My focus has been to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."""

The tech giant said it did not allow fraudulent activity and worked closely with Stop Scams UK to protect users. One company removed from the platform is C'est La Vie, but had a returns address in China. Mabel & Daisy, which used AI generated pictures of a mother and daughter and claimed to sell ""timeless clothing"" from a shop in Bristol, has also been removed from the platform after it was exposed for selling cheap items from a base in Hong Kong. Other companies Meta says it is taking action against are clothing firms Sylvia & Grace, Chester & Claire, Harrison & Hayes and Olyndra London, as well as accessories business Omelia & Oliver Jewels. All have one-star reviews on Trustpilot with hundreds of customers saying they were duped into thinking they were buying from UK-based brands and received shoddy goods. Harrison & Hayes claimed to be a Manchester-based independent clothes shop with ""decades of experience"" but has a returns address to a central warehouse in China. It has used an AI-image of a shop front in the city which does not exist. Chester & Clare also uses an AI-generated image of a shopfront to market its business, which it claims has operated in London since 2005 but is actually based in the Netherlands and sells clothes shipped from China. Its terms of service states imagery, stories, characters and boutique locations ""may have been created using generate AI"" to ""enhance customer experience"". The BBC contacted all businesses but only got automated responses. Claire Brown was persuaded to buy two dresses for £73 from Luxe and Luna London, after ""constantly"" seeing the company's appealing adverts on Facebook. When the dresses arrived weeks later they were poorly made of flimsy material and ""looked awful"". ""It felt like a trusted brand after I'd seen it on Facebook so much, you see all these clothing collections and I liked what I saw,"" she said. Ms Brown, who works in tech marketing, said she reported the company to Meta but never got a response. The company has now stopped operating, with stating life had ""taken a devastating turn"" because of the death of a partner, an almost identical statement used by fake Birmingham jewellery business C'est La Vie. ""It makes me feel really cross, because I hate people being scammed and the websites are the kind of thing you would share with a friend,"" Claire added. ""There is a real lack of protection here for consumers."" Another Facebook user, Stuart, said he had reported a number of suspicious companies to the platform but was advised to ""influence the ads that you see by hiding ads and changing your ad preferences"" in its response. No other action was taken. Some of the fraudulent companies discovered by the BBC appear to be . That's where a third-party buys products from a wholesaler and sells them with a significant mark-up, having never seen the product themselves. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) recently that used images of roses, cobbled streets and the union jack when it was shipping goods from a warehouse in Asia. The regulator said it was continuing to take action on misleading adverts but said platforms like Facebook played an ""important role"" in maintaining ""responsible advertising"" and continued to engage with them on how best to prevent those that break the rules. Which? said Meta had allowed fake companies to ""run rampant on its platforms for too long"" and said it should be doing ""much more"" to stop scams and protect its users. Meta said it wanted users to report suspicious adverts on its platforms, which was an ""important signal"" to its review systems and could prompt a re-review of the advert while improving policies."
China US,Mum and baby fire plea sent to woman in Manchester,2025-11-28T19:08:29.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0nld5v87zo,"A woman in Manchester said she received pleas for help from a mum who was stuck in a Hong Kong flat fire with her newborn baby. At least after the and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. The cause of the fire remains unclear though officials said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread. Cherry moved to Manchester three years ago but she grew up in the complex and is still on a residents' group chat where she saw the pleas for help. Cherry said she did not sleep on Wednesday night. ""I felt really really sad because I knew I couldn't do anything,"" she said. ""I was seeing messages from people still in the fire asking for help, pleading to be saved. ""What I most strongly remember was a mother - she was in the fire with her three-month-old baby, messaging for help. She told us the address and said 'please help to save us'. ""A lot of people downstairs were writing support to her, telling her how to keep stable and calm until the firemen came."" Cherry told Radio Manchester that the mother and baby were rescued and were safe and well. ""They are in hospital for monitoring,"" she said. But Cherry said they were not the only residents who were trapped like this. Cherry said she believed ongoing maintenance work, flammable materials and a lack of working fire alarms were responsible for the scale of the tragedy. ""There is green mesh outside the building because of the maintenance work,"" she said. ""However in Hong Kong there is no understanding that this mesh needed to be fire resistant. ""The residents say they have tested the mesh nets and found out that the material was not fire resistant and they are angry. ""They are thinking about how they pay so much money but didn't get what they needed, didn't get anything to protect their lives."" Authorities are investigating the incident. ""It is too late now,"" said Cherry. ""I think what we should be doing is looking at how to prevent this happening again for a second time,"" she added. on suspicion of corruption over the renovation work at the complex. Three others were also detained earlier on manslaughter charges."
China US,"Britain won't beat the US in AI race, says ex-Google scientist",2025-11-24T06:43:20.856Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e7mj0jmro,"A computer scientist who revolutionised the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has called for the UK to be ""brave"" in its pursuit of the technology. Llion Jones, who was part of the pioneering Google team that unlocked AI's ability to respond in a human-like form, warned against trying to compete with ""hyper-scalers"" in the United States and China. He said the ""sycophantic"" responses of the current wave of AI chatbots needed to be fixed. ""We need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you,"" he said. Mr Jones, who was raised in Bangor and Abergynolwyn in Gwynedd, north Wales, is one of the co-authors of , which introduced the Transformer architecture that put the ""T"" in ChatGPT. It was a breakthrough that now underpins the generative AI systems that are transforming business and everyday life. Still based in Tokyo, he is now the chief technology officer of Sakana AI, the firm he founded with another former Google researcher. His company focuses on speculative research into future uses of AI, something he claimed was ""unique"", as other big tech firms were focused on monetising the current wave of large language models. ""I do genuinely think that we are unique in that respect right now,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I'm trying to make the environment to give people the freedom to do the research they want, and I'm going to try and protect it as long as I can."" Mr Jones said governments in Cardiff and Westminster needed to accept the reality of a global race which was being won by America and China, and focus instead on different types of AI developments. ""I think a country like Wales, or even Britain in general, is not going to beat the hyper-scalers, right? They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs. ""It doesn't make any sense to be a part of that race, because you're not going to win. ""So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave."" He argued that ""something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research"". ""It's a bit of a longer bet, but if it pays off then you're back in the race, right?"" While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations. Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology. ""AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,"" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle. Some of the businesses at the event ""are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,"" he added. ""If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,"" Kyle said. He added that a 1% increase in small business productivity would generate £240bn worth of economic activity. AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to ""drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive"". It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology. Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government. But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales. There have been to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas. ""Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,"" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons. Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands. ""What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,"" he said. ""There's so much more benefit that comes from the modernisation of grid infrastructure. ""When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible."" Mr George warned Wales could ""lose out"" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions. Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant ""the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly"". While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots. ""They've become very sycophantic,"" he said. The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them. ""Unfortunately, humans love being told that they're right. ""This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.' ""So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you."""
China US,Trump's plan for Gaza backed by UN Security Council,2025-11-18T02:03:30.771Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpkgq4wllo,"The UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza. Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained. Adopting it was an ""important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire"", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan ""imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject"". ""Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,"" it added. Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas. Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be ""tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians"". The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force. Trump called the Security Council vote ""historic"" and said it was a way of ""acknowledging and endorsing"" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. ""This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for. Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text. The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to ""translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground"" and lead to ""a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution"". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution. The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented ""urgently and immediately"". Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it. Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution. The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a ""fragile, fragile first step"". Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack. More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
China US,'My heart breaks every time I'm called a hero' - Hong Kong fire survivor,2025-12-03T23:13:49.458Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2054rdv52o,"William Li has struggled with the label ""hero"" since helping his neighbours escape the fire which engulfed the Hong Kong block of flats he had called home since birth. Instead, he is haunted by guilt that he could have saved more people from the blaze at Wang Fuk Court, which left at least 159 people dead. ""My heart breaks every time someone calls me a hero,"" says the 40-year-old, breaking down in tears. A week on from the disaster, firefighters are still combing the complex of seven burnt-out high rises for the remains of 30 of Mr Li's neighbours - people who, like him, had the misfortune to be at home when the deadly fire began. What caused the fire to start, and why more people did not escape, is now the subject of an independent committee's investigation, ordered by Hong Kong's chief executive. Already, it has been revealed that non-fire resistant netting had been fitted around the building, and the fire alarms were not working properly. The fact alarms did not go off was the reason why Mr Li was not more worried when his wife called to tell him a fire had started in their building, Wang Cheong House. Instead of rushing, he spent almost 10 minutes packing belongings. But the moment he opened the door, the extent of the disaster was all too clear: he was engulfed in billowing smoke and had to retreat inside his flat. On the other end of the phone, his wife became hysterical, but Mr Li didn't have time to panic. He had to put wet towels under the door to stop the smoke from getting in, and tried to work out what to do next. It was then he heard voices in the corridor, where the air was now so dense with smoke he was unable to see who was calling out. Covering his face with a wet towel, he found two of his neighbours by touch, dragging the couple inside to the relative safety of his flat. In a neighbouring block, Bai Shui Lin was also trying to help her neighbours. The 66-year-old is thought to have saved at least three families, banging on their doors to warn them of the fire. Mrs Bai did not survive, however. Her sons identified her body at the weekend. ""If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,"" Yip Ka-Kui told the BBC's US partner, CBS. ""But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others."" Back in Mr Li's flat, the middle aged couple revealed they had heard another voice in the corridor: a domestic worker calling for an elderly woman. But now, the voice had gone quiet. This time, Mr Li was unable to help. ""I feel very guilty,"" he said. ""Some people weren't saved and I didn't open my door again and try to find them."" Mr Li does not know yet what happened to the voice in the corridor. Nine Indonesian and one Filipino domestic workers are reportedly among the dead, but others survived - including Rhodora Alcaraz, 28, who was trapped in another flat looking after her employer's three-month-old baby and elderly mother. She too has been hailed a hero for staying by their side. All three were rescued by firefighters eventually - but not before Ms Alcaraz had sent a series of voice messages to her sister. ""I'm feeling very weak. I can't breathe,"" she said in one of the clips, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Li and the couple - named in local media as the Chows - realised they too needed to escape. Several hours had elapsed, and their options were running out. One fire exit was blocked by the flames, while Mr Li's neighbour believed the other was locked. They decided not to jump out of the second floor window due to the intensity of the fire, and the constant explosions. A subsidiary of Danish company ISS, the property manager of Wang Fuk Court, has not responded to a BBC inquiry over reports that the emergency exit was locked. ""It was the first time I felt death had something to do with me,"" says Mr Li. That's why he started saying goodbye to friends one by one via WhatsApp: ""I can't escape,"" he told them. ""If something happens to me take care of my children. Look after yourselves."" About two and a half hours after the blaze began, firefighters finally reached them on an aerial ladder. Mrs Chow told HK01, a Hong Kong-based news outlet, that Mr Li insisted the firefighters should get them out first. ""We are older and told him he should leave first. He refused and said he was young and could handle this."" When the firefighters came back for him, Mr Li felt reluctant to leave his home, which was filled with fond memories and treasured collections of photography equipment and toys. ""The fire was telling me that I couldn't take anything away, that I had no right or power to stop it from devouring everything."" Mr Li reunited with his family at a nearby fast food restaurant. But after he'd reached hospital it took until the early hours of the morning for the true extent of the horror he'd endured to make itself felt. ""I no longer had any strength in me and when I got to the emergency room, my knees gave in. A burning smell lingered in my nose,"" he says. ""I really wanted to wash away the smell."" After being admitted to a ward at 03:00, Mr Li finally had the space to cry and start trying to process the ordeal he had gone through. ""When I had been to hospital before, I wanted to go home as soon as possible,"" he says. ""But this time when the nurse asked me [if I wanted to go home], I wasn't willing to leave. I felt like I was avoiding what I would have to face in the future."" He has however decided to face the trauma upfront – by doing as many interviews as he can. ""I hope many people will come forward to help find the truth,"" he says. ""I hope Wang Fuk Court residents will be given answers and justice."""
China US,Gardeners unearth stolen phones left by snatchers,2025-11-25T06:00:33.440Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vm6p3vjd2o,"Volunteers at a community garden in central London have been reuniting phone theft victims with their stolen devices after finding them buried in flower-beds. The Phoenix Garden, off Shaftesbury Avenue in Covent Garden, has seen snatchers stash stolen phones in its grounds due to its proximity to the West End, in an issue first reported by . Garden volunteers said they collected the phones from bushes and flower-beds and handed them to their owners or the police. As a result, fewer devices have been unearthed in recent weeks. Louise Gates, Phoenix Garden manager, said she often found phones ""thrown over the fence from the night before"" when she unlocked the garden in the morning. ""Some of our volunteers have dug up phones wrapped in tin foil,"" Ms Gates added. Tinfoil is often used by phone snatchers to stop the device's location being detected. It is believed that snatchers, often on electric bikes around hotspot areas like Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, have been temporarily stashing the phones in the garden for collection at a later date. Ms Gates said some of the theft victims had arrived at the garden after tracking their device's signal through Apple's Find My app. Ms Gates said if she could find the emergency contact information on the phone, she called the number provided. ""They're all really so grateful, which is nice,"" she said. ""Other times I charge it up, but nobody rings, I don't know who it belongs to or I can't find them on social media, so I just take it to the police station."" Ron Chenery, a volunteer of two years, said finding phones was a regular occurrence. ""Most of us love the garden so much, we're constantly out in the fresh air. If we see something we hand it in,"" he said. Community worker Elliot Hughes, who helps local students access the garden and get into nature, said it was important to teach young people about the wider risks of phone theft across the capital. ""The best we can do is give awareness"" he said. ""There's young people now, walking around central London on their phones, in the middle of the street, which are essentially £1,000 computers. ""So [I am] just highlighting to them maybe the things they shouldn't be doing."" A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said local officers had stepped up patrols in the area to identify potential phone snatching offenders. ""By intensifying our efforts we're catching more perpetrators and protecting people from having their phone stolen in the capital and have reduced theft by 16% since April. ""We're also dismantling organised crime groups suspected of large-scale phone theft."" The force called on phone companies including Apple and Samsung for security improvements that would make stolen phones harder to sell."
China US,Namibia loses bid to overturn ban on rhino horn trade,2025-12-05T14:24:32.464Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30j7q6qjp9o,"Namibia's proposals to lift the ban on the international trade in black and white rhino horns have been rejected at a key conservation meeting. The result of the voting at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) earlier this week was adopted by the conference on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Namibia had also proposed overturning the ban on African savanna elephant ivory - this too was defeated. Eyebrows were raised about the rhino horn trade proposals mainly because Namibia pioneered the practice of cutting the horns off rhinos in 1989 so they no longer have value for poachers. Dehorning was followed by other southern African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa. Rhino horns are prized in traditional Asian medicine and are also status symbols in China, Vietnam, and some other south-east Asian countries. Namibia tabled two separate proposals - one for black rhinos and the other for southern white rhino. Both were resoundingly defeated, with only around 30 votes out of about 120 in favour. Cites regulations require a two-thirds majority for a proposal to be adopted. Black rhinos are listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2023, there were only 6,421 alive - a decline of more than 90% since 1960, according to an IUCN report. The southern white rhinos are not in quite such danger - they are listed as near threatened, with a population of  15,752. But this is down 11% since 2023 and at its lowest point since the current rhino poaching crisis began nearly two decades ago. Cites banned the trade in the horns and other rhino parts in 1977 but their poaching continued with more than 8,000 lost in the last decade, according to Save the Rhino International. In Namibia, the number of rhinos poached was the highest on record in 2022, with 87 killed - almost twice as many as the year before, government data shows. Although this was the first time that Namibia tabled the two proposals seeking the lifting of the ban on the rhino horn trade, the country has backed similar proposals by other southern African countries including South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe in the past. Experts say the main reason these countries want the ban to be lifted is because of the huge stockpiles of rhino horns they have amassed over the years. ""Namibia and other pro-trade rhino range states have amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn they wish to trade,"" Taylor Tench, senior wildlife policy analyst with the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the BBC. ""Namibia's stockpiles are an estimated 6.45 tonnes of white rhino horn and an estimated 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horn. South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much."" The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme. The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed. The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless. But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly. As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating. ""The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,"" said Mr Tench. ""Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised."" The governments of both countries have been approached for comment. Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts. Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures. But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching. They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues. Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN. South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said."
China US,Putin says Russia ready to supply 'uninterrupted' fuel to India ,2025-12-05T12:50:31.387Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g482m3yyzo,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide ""uninterrupted shipments"" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil. Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow. President Donald Trump has imposed , arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies. Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a ""peaceful solution"" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas ""Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,"" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on ""the side of peace"", welcoming efforts to find a ""lasting"" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the ""connectivity"" of Russia and India was a ""major priority"" for India. In recent months, India-US ties have hit an as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"" at the time. In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US. ""The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,"" he asked. Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May. The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture. Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia. Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said. No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry. Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years. Modi said that ""energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership"", but made no specific reference to oil. India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions. Putin also referenced a ""flagship project"": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with. In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being ""reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms"". Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a ""more just"" and ""multi-polar"" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations."
China US,Zambian-American influencer sentenced to 18 months for hate speech,2025-12-02T14:58:51.583Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqnklqge7o,"A Zambian-American influencer and political vlogger has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech for making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema. Zambian-born Ethel Chisono Edwards, who also holds US citizenship and works as an estate agent in New York, has a large following across various social media accounts. Known as ""One Boss Lady"", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years. The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral. She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments. But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common. Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year. She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred. Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential. He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment. He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf. ""I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,"" it said. Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona. The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest. Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence. The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech. Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws. In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema."

China US,China exempts chips used by carmakers from export curbs,2025-11-10T07:02:17.905Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rp2514g4qo,"China has lifted export controls on computer chips vital to car production, the country's commerce ministry said on Sunday. Exemptions have been granted to exports made by Chinese-owned Nexperia for civilian use, it said, which should help carmakers who had feared production in Europe would be hit. At the same time, China has also paused an export ban to the US of some materials that are crucial in the semiconductor industry and suspended port fees for American ships. The moves mark an easing of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed in October to reduce tariffs on each other and pause other measures for a year. In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by Chinese company Wingtech, to try to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other goods. In response, China blocked exports of the firm's finished chips. However, it said earlier this month as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China. While Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. When it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to ""serious governance shortcomings"" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency. But when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues. In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted. Earlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that ""supply shortages were imminent"". Volvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business. But on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic that China had agreed to ""the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips"" and it would ""grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter"" provided the goods were for ""civilian use"". ""Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows."" , China's commerce ministry called on ""the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible."" Prof David Bailey from Birmingham University's business school told the BBC's Today programme that the actions of China were a ""wake-up call"" for the motor industry. ""The Dutch government may well have had good reasons to try and take control but it hadn't thought through the implications of that,"" he said. ""The retaliation from China was swift and it was brutal."" He said there was a need to find alternative processing sites, ""maybe in south east Asia, or Europe"", and for the industry to keep bigger stocks of its products in case of shortages. Meanwhile, the suspension of a ban on exports of ""dual-use items"" related to gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials to the US came into effect on Sunday and will be in place until 27 November, 2026. The ban on the exports of goods and materials that can have both civilian and military uses was announced in December 2024. China's transport ministry also said port fees charged on US-linked ships would be suspended for a for a year, effective 0501 GMT Monday. On Friday, China also announced the suspension of other export controls related to expanded curbs on some rare earth materials and lithium batteries."
China US,Reform or rights rollback? India's sweeping labour law overhaul sparks debate,2025-11-28T00:00:09.578Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwk28d5yzxo,"Last week, India announced it would implement what many say are its most far-reaching economic reforms in decades - compressing 29 federal laws that regulated labour into . As a result, the number of rules that govern labour have now come down from a staggering 1,400 to around 350, while the number of forms companies had to fill in this regard have reduced from 180 to 73 - drastically lightening the regulatory burden on businesses. The laws got a parliamentary nod in 2020 but are finally set to be uniformly implemented across the country after a five-year delay and much political wrangling. Companies - which have long blamed restrictive labour practices for the atrophy in India's manufacturing sector - have given the changes a rousing welcome. ""This is part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of Trump's 50% tariffs, and an important signal that it is keen to ease doing business in India, attract more FDI [foreign direct investment] and integrate into GVCs [global value chains],"" said Nomura, a broking house. But trade unions are asking for their withdrawal and calling the codes the most ""sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers' hard-won rights and entitlements since [India's] independence"". The changes have triggered demonstrations across the country, with 200-300 people turning up at a protest in capital Delhi on Wednesday, led largely by left-leaning trade unions not aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. At the protest site, Akashdeep Singh, a 33-year-old factory worker employed at an international beverage company on the outskirts of Delhi, told the BBC that ""the laws will benefit only the employers and not workers like us"". Several others expressed similar anxieties. The government says the long-pending reforms aim to modernise outdated laws, simplify compliance, and protect workers' rights - while giving legal recognition to India's growing gig workforce for the first time. Several worker-friendly measures - mandatory appointment letters, uniform minimum wages, free annual health check-ups for those over 40, and gender-neutral pay - are welcome steps. Coupled with fewer compliance burdens, stronger social security, and an expanded definition of employees to include gig workers, these reforms could help formalise India's vast informal economy, experts say. The new codes also iron out glaring inconsistencies, such as varied definitions of the same rules that were prevalent in the previous laws, according to Arvind Panagariya, economist at Columbia University and former chairman of the Indian government's think tank Niti Aayog. ""You could not implement 100% of the Indian labour laws without violating 20% of them,"" Prof Panagariya in the Times of India newspaper. But even with the many welcome provisions, two contentious clauses in the reforms have particularly irked unions. These include rules that will make it easier for companies to fire workers and also harder for workers to legally conduct strikes. Earlier, factories with 100 or more workers needed the government's permission before they could lay off employees. Now, that threshold has been increased to 300. ""Why is the government trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce from the labour legislation?"" Sudeep Dutta, national secretary of CITU (Centre for Indian Trade Unions), told the BBC. ""Pending grievance cases for labourers are already in millions. Cases are not being registered… workers are not able to lodge their complaints and now the government is bringing in a labour code which is trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce,"" he added. Mr Dutta also said the new rules which ask workers to give a 14-day notice before going on strike - earlier applicable only to state-run companies - are further snatching away workers' powers to collectively bargain. Economists like Prof Panagariya argue that the old rules barring layoffs in firms with 100 or more workers were ""draconian,"" hampering India's competitiveness compared to countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China. He writes that a flexible labour market is key for India to attract entrepreneurs, as China did decades ago, to bring capital, technology, and global links - catalysts for economic transformation. Nomura economists agree, saying that the increase in worker threshold limit for retrenchment/closure ""should encourage firms to build larger scale factories, boosting the manufacturing sector, and expanding employment opportunities over time"". But economists like Prof Arun Kumar argue that labour restrictions alone do not explain India's weak competitiveness or the slow private-sector investment in new factories. ""Inadequate private investment is not due to these laws but due to inadequate demand, as wages [in India] are low, so mass demand remains low,"" Prof Kumar told the BBC. ""The new labour code will not have any impact on these aspects."" He warns against weakening workers' bargaining power, especially as technology displaces jobs and unemployment remains high. ""It is an issue of retaining the few rights that existed under the old system even though it was highly flawed,"" said Prof Kumar. While ideological differences remain, experts broadly agree that the outdated and complex codes - often used by inspectors to harass factory owners - needed simplification. With over half of India's working-age population out of the labour force and nearly 60% of workers self-employed, it's clear the old rules were failing. The impact of the new rules on India's manufacturing growth and investment remains uncertain, but in the short term, the transition will pose challenges for companies. ""Organisations will need to prepare for changes to wage structures, HR systems, social security provisioning and compliance governance,"" according to staffing agency BDO India. Since labour is regulated by both state and central rules, employers may face dual compliance for a while, says BDO India, even as the government deals with ongoing resistance from unions."
China US,Thailand extradites owner of Myanmar scam city to China,2025-11-12T07:02:44.288Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20xx2pl69o,"She Zhijiang, a Chinese national accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, is being extradited to China - ending his years-long battle against the order. He has been detained in Thailand since 2022, after the Thai police arrested him acting on a Chinese request to Interpol. China accuses She Zhijiang of running illegal online gambling rings, and this week a Thai court upheld the decision to extradite him.  He arrived at a Bangkok airport on Wednesday, flanked by two security officials. His extradition comes ahead of a landmark visit by Thailand's king to Beijing - the first state visit to China by a reigning Thai monarch and a sign of deepening ties. She Zhijiang is one of the biggest names linked to the vast cyberscam hubs in South East Asia, which have trapped thousands of Chinese nationals and sparked a crackdown from Beijing. One of his most notorious projects is Myanmar's Shwe Kokko city, near the Thai border. It's portrayed in promotional videos as a resort city for Chinese tourists, but its glitzy buildings are allegedly home to fraud, money laundering and human trafficking. During a , the BBC saw very few overseas visitors. Local people there said that scam businesses were still operating. She Zhijiang and his company Yatai is sanctioned by the UK and the US for his links to rights abuses in the scam farms in their development. Speaking to the BBC from prison earlier this year, She Zhijiang maintained that his company would ""never accept telecom fraud and scams"" - though he also noted admitted that scammers were likely to enter Shwe Kokko since the city was ""completely open to anyone"". Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, She Zhijiang left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China. In 2014 a Chinese court convicted him of running an illegal lottery. But over the years he expanded his gambling business to Cambodia and other countries in the region. He also holds Cambodian and Myanmar citizenship, according to the US Treasury. The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in scam centres concentrated in South East Asia. They are often lured there by fake job offers and held against their will, forced to defraud others online or face brutal punishment. Many of them are Chinese nationals - a source of concern for Beijing. China has been ramping up crackdowns on such scam operations. In recent months it has ."
China US,"Australia at risk of 'high-impact sabotage' from China, says spy chief",2025-11-12T03:27:44.652Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n43emvejo,"Australia's spy chief says hackers linked to the Chinese government and military are targeting the country's critical infrastructure, warning the country was increasingly at risk of ""high-impact sabotage"". Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), said ""unprecedented levels of espionage"" meant a growing threat of ""cyber-enabled sabotage"" in the next five years. He singled out ""one nation state - no prizes for guessing which one - conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate critical infrastructure in Australia"" and its allies, ""targeting water, transport, telecommunications, and energy networks"". The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment. Authoritarian regimes were now more willing to ""disrupt and destroy,"" Burgess warned. He cited two Chinese hacking groups, Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, and Australia. ""These groups are hackers working for Chinese government intelligence and their military,"" he told business leaders at a forum in Melbourne on Wednesday. ""Both groups were involved in the theft of sensitive information, but the real danger was the threat of sabotage - disruption to critical infrastructure."" He said Salt Typhoon's intent was espionage, breaking into telecommunication networks in the US. ""And they have been probing our telecommunication networks here in Australia too,"" Burgess said. He said Volt Typhoon's actions were intended to be disruptive, with hackers compromising critical infrastructure networks in the US for potential, future sabotage. ""And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well,"" Burgess said. He warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to sabotage critical infrastructure in order to ""impede decision-making, damage the economy, undermine war-fighting capability and sow social discord"". ""I do not think we - and I mean all of us - truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,"" he said. Burgess pointed out that , unrelated to foreign interference, have had significant and widespread impacts on society. ""That's one phone network not working for less than one day,"" he said. ""Imagine the implications if a nation-state took down all the networks? Or turned off the power during a heatwave? Or polluted our drinking water? Or crippled our financial system?"" Spies are increasingly ""broadening their collection requirements"", Burgess said. ""They are aggressively targeting private sector projects, negotiations and investments that might give foreign companies a commercial advantage. And like criminals, they have been aggressively targeting customer data."" The spy chief said conservative estimates showed that espionage cost Australia A$12.5bn ($8.2bn; £6.2bn) in 2023-24, with about $2bn worth of trade secrets and intellectual property stolen from Australian companies in one year. Burgess described the hackers' abilities as ""highly sophisticated, using top-notch tradecraft to find your networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks"". ""And when they have penetrated your networks, they actively and aggressively map your systems, and seek to maintain persistent undetected access that enables them to conduct sabotage at a time and moment of their choosing."""
China US,India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at COP30 climate summit,2025-11-21T01:17:06.411Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v8k8mlego,"At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter. India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being ""worryingly inadequate"". Delhi has argued otherwise. Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming. So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change. The that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement. But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies. UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets. The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it. All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap. But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem. Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December. So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30? Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world. A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that ""global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone"". ""For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,"" he wrote. While , Yadav seemed to expand on this argument. ""Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,"" he said. Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries. The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue. The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn. Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans. Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot. ""The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,"" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30. Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states. India says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline. Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges. Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as "" "". It has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C. Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal. In the , published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU. ""India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,"" a report by the think-tank noted. According to the recent , India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia. But the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan. And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels. It remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends."
China US,Chatham Docks steel firm puts 85 jobs at risk,2025-12-05T10:54:00.531Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gwx1lqdno,"A steel manufacturer based at Chatham Docks has confirmed it is consulting on redundancies for 85 employees. ArcelorMittal Kent Wire, the largest steel manufacturer in Europe, began the process last week ahead of pulling out of the site on Pier Road. The company was among the opponents to now-approved plans to redevelop the docks, claiming they would be forced out of the location should they proceed. A spokesperson from ArcelorMittal Kent Wire said: ""We have informed all employees of the decision to enter a consultation process, with all jobs at the site at risk due to the severity and scale of the challenges facing the business."" The firm has faced difficulties, such as low demand, competition from China, and US tariffs, according to the . Peel Waters, which owns the site, had an application to approved by Medway Council in May 2024. An unsuccessful request to made by then-MP for Rochester and Strood Kelly Tolhurst, meant the Basin 3 proposal was not officially approved until November 2024. The application remains subject to a judicial review, which was heard at the High Court on October 29 and 30. A ruling has not yet been made. ArcelorMittal Kent Wire was one of the businesses opposed to the plan, as was the Save Chatham Docks campaign group. Peel Waters also wants to build a 950-home development on the site, which would include a supermarket and a pub. Ms Tolhurst, who campaigned to save the jobs, said she was ""absolutely devastated for the people at the docks"". ""For some people, it will be life-changing. It's not a booming jobs market at the moment, so for those people it's going to be a really frightening time right on top of Christmas,"" she said. A spokesperson for Peel Waters said: ""For over 10 years, we have tried to work with ArcelorMittal Kent Wire and other tenants to explore relocation solutions, including suggesting suitable local port locations that could meet their operational needs... ""Subject to the outcome of the ongoing judicial review, we remain committed to delivering Basin 3."""
China US,Charity shop finds sold for thousands at auction,2025-11-15T07:26:26.854Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1xqd9j1o,"Two pieces of Chinese porcelain discovered in charity shops have sold for thousands of pounds at auction. The items were taken to Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, whose chairman and Asian art specialist, John Axford, identified them as Chinese works from the 19th Century. A ""five dragon"" dish, which was due to be sold at a Dorset charity shop for £2, went under the hammer for £7,620 and a blue and white ""dragon"" bottle vase sold for £5,080. ""These discoveries highlight the extraordinary treasures that can still be found in the most unexpected places,"" said Mr Axford. An astute manager at the charity shop in Blandford Forum thought it was worth getting the dish valued. Mr Axford said he ""immediately recognised"" the period of the piece, due to its distinctive blue and yellow decoration. Further findings, such as the six-character Emperor Daoguang mark of the period (1821-1850) also confirmed its link to the Chinese Imperial Collection. The proceeds will go directly to the charity of the shop where it was discovered. ""These do not come onto the market very often; they're usually held in public collections or sometimes in private collections and this one has been languishing about somewhere in the south west of England,"" said Mr Axford. ""A lot of quite important Chinese imperial porcelains were brought back to Europe following the fall of the Qing dynasty. ""Almost all of the interest in the sale was from mainland China and Hong Kong,"" he said. The blue and white bottle vase was spotted by an eagle-eyed shopper in a charity shop in Surrey, for which she paid £100. Impressed by its craftsmanship, she brought the piece to Mr Axford, who confirmed that it dated from the first half of the 19th Century. ""Not only are these items culturally and historically significant but in the case of the dish, the sale will directly benefit a good cause,"" he added."
China US,Tesla looks to reset strategy amid sluggish India sales,2025-11-27T07:40:11.867Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrn00pn1m7o,"Tesla has opened its largest sales and service hub in India even as the EV giant struggles with weak sales in Asia's third-largest economy. The centre in the northern city of Gurugram combines an experience showroom, charging, and after-sales services under one roof. The EV maker has sold just over 100 cars in India since its much publicised debut in July this year, dealership data shows. Sources close to the company told the BBC that Tesla is now focusing on strengthening India's EV ecosystem in a bid to revive sales momentum. Tesla didn't directly respond to BBC queries on the low sales figures. The Elon Musk owned EV maker has been struggling to get a foothold in India since its launch in July, receiving bookings for barely over 600 cars till mid-September, according to . Dealership data accessed by the BBC shows only a small portion of these bookings  converted into sales since deliveries started in September, even as competitor models in the premium category, from brands like BMW, BYD and Mercedes Benz reported robust sales aided by festive demand and tax cuts. The EV maker's plan to improve sales is said to include a three-pronged strategy to increase adoption, install more charging stations across the country and boost customer experience. High taxes and slow adoption remain major barriers to EV growth in India, experts say. For Tesla, the steep upfront price of its cars is another challenge. But speaking at the Tesla Centre launch in Gurugram, India head Sharad Agarwal said buyers can recoup up to two million rupees ($22,400; £16,900) over four years on fuel and maintenance - a third of the price of its Model Y sold here. ""Most of the [maintenance] service is done remotely through software updates, which reduces cost of ownership. And cost of home charging is one tenth of petrol prices,""Mr Agarwal said. ""Their [sales] numbers are low by any standard,"" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India told the BBC. ""But I think that's strategic. They have just put their foot in the door in India. And they have good potential to increase sales here in the time to come."" EVs make up less than 3% of passenger vehicle sales in India, and charging infrastructure has been slow to develop -  the country has only Tesla's cars can be charged at home, adding up to 44 miles (70.8km) of range per hour. The company is also expanding its network, including superchargers that can deliver about 170 miles in 15 minutes. Tesla's weak India sales come amid a broader slowdown in demand across its biggest markets -  Europe, China and the US. The company's profits fell in October despite record quarterly revenue, boosted by a last-minute rush from US buyers to claim an expiring tax credit. The firm said revenue for the three months to the end of September hit a record $28bn (£21bn), up 12% from the same time last year. But the company's profits dropped by 37% for the same period, partly due to extra costs linked to tariffs and research and development. In India, Musk has shown in local manufacturing, opting for an import-led strategy despite incentives announced in March last year to attract global EV makers."
China US,"They can't crush our protests, vow Georgians after year of resistance",2025-11-27T00:03:12.454Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c208w378gg7o,"""I'm standing for the future of this country,"" says Giorgi Arabuli, who has taken part in protests on the streets of Georgia's capital Tbilisi almost every night since they began a year ago. Mass demonstrations were met with violent police crackdowns as tens of thousands of Georgians turned out, angered by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's decision on 28 November 2024 to call a four-year halt on moves towards joining the EU. ""I'm from the generation of the 1990s. I've seen those dark times after the civil war,"" said Giorgi. ""Most of it was caused by Russian influence in a post-Soviet country. We don't want to go back there."" Since then Georgians have seen a ""dismantling of democracy"", , and it has prompted accusations of Russian-style rule. On the streets, the protests have evolved into a grinding war of attrition. For months, Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue was blocked for a few hours every evening. New laws and a heavy police presence forced the protesters to adapt, marching through adjacent streets and facing nightly arrests. The Georgian Dream government has imposed massive fines for blocking roads, slapped criminal charges on young protesters and most recently pushed through a law allowing up to 14 days' imprisonment for a first offence of blocking traffic, with repeat offenders facing up to a year in jail. ""Freedom for regime prisoners,"" reads a large banner carried towards the nearby Supreme Court. ""They've used every method to crush the protests... but the fact is they haven't been able to,"" says Nata Koridze. Her husband, Zura Japaridze, is one of six key opposition figures jailed after refusing to testify before a parliamentary commission into alleged crimes by the previous government. The six were jailed for up to eight months and banned from holding public office for two years. Prosecutors have since announced new charges against eight opposition leaders, including Japaridze. They now face up to 15 years for alleged sabotage and aiding foreign powers. Nata Koridze's husband is due to be released on 22 December but she says he is due to appear in court again three days later. They are accused of communicating with Western partners about government abuses - standard democratic practice - as evidence of betraying state interests. Japaridze, like all the jailed politicians, is held in solitary confinement. ""Zura has not seen anybody except for a doctor and the guard,"" she says. Georgia's path to EU membership, once the cornerstone of its post-Soviet identity, is now farther away than ever. Earlier this month, the EU's annual enlargement report delivered what , concluding it was now considered an EU candidate ""in name only"". ""Georgia is not on the trajectory to become an EU member state, neither in 2030 nor later,"" said Pawel Herczynski, rejecting the government's pledge to ensure membership by 2030. The BBC approached the head of the parliamentary committee on European integration and other Georgian Dream MPs for comment, but no-one was available. The government's public response has been increasingly hostile towards its foreign critics. Parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili has accused the EU of ""ideological and political dictates"", telling pro-government TV this month that ""today's Brussels does not want a Georgia that is like us"". ""They want a country standing on one foot,"" he complained. ""The policies and approaches in Brussels must be changed. For them, the Georgian people and their choice mean nothing, zero."" Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, won 54% of the vote in last year's disputed parliamentary elections, which monitors from Europe's OSCE security mission said were marked by several shortcomings, including intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, especially public sector employees. All opposition parties have since boycotted parliament leaving it entirely in government hands. That means increasingly repressive legislation has been passed unopposed. As well as steep fines for protesters blocking the road, there have been a restrictive broadcasting law and a law on foreign grants requiring all foreign funding for civil society and media to be approved by a government commission. Hundreds of protesters have been fined and dozens jailed, among them well-known actor Andro Chichinadze, given two years for allegedly organising protests. His theatre - once the best attended in Tbilisi - has closed in solidarity. The belief that Georgia's government is acting in Russia's interest is widespread among pro-Europeans here. They point to the ruling party's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s; legislation mirroring Russian laws targeting civil society; the government's refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine and increasingly hostile anti-Western rhetoric. Georgia's leaders reject that portrayal, describing their approach towards Russia as ""pragmatic"" and their primary duty to maintain peace with their northern neighbour. ""Where are the facts?"" said Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, denying pro-Russian bias during a recent TV interview. The government, he said, was being ""responsible to Georgian society which wants to keep peace in the country"". That is not the view of one of Georgia's most respected journalists, Mzia Amaglobeli, imprisoned for two years for slapping a police officer. ""Russia is conquering us without war. An oligarch is ruling our country, depriving us of a European future and legitimising autocratic, dictatorial rule. We need the support of the democratic world,"" she told the BBC in a handwritten letter from prison. for Freedom of Thought next month, says she has lost the sight of one eye and her remaining vision is worsening in solitary confinement: ""I have difficulty reading for even 10-15 minutes at a time."" Georgia's democratic decline intensified even before last year's elections, with a June 2024 Russian-style law on foreign influence that targeted civil society and independent media. Students played a big part in protests at the time and the government has responded with sweeping education reforms planned next February. Georgia's 19 state universities will be required to concentrate on a single academic discipline under the slogan ""one city, one faculty"". The reforms will tackle perceived problems including excessive concentration of universities in Tbilisi, duplication of programmes and inadequate state funding. The prime minister argues that funding should be ""focused on fulfilling state tasks"". Leading figures at Georgia's pre-eminent research institution, Ilia State University, say the reform is more about imposing political control and eradicating free space. ""After political parties, media and NGOs, universities must be put under pressure,"" says Nina Doborjginidze, rector of Ilia State University. ""If students are removed from the capital, they're removed from the political scene."" ""This is not about education quality, it's a political project,"" adds vice-rector Georgi Gvalia. ""This is an abrupt change in Georgia's foreign policy from being one of the most pro-European countries in the region to the most difficult partners of the West, and change towards more autocratic great powers, like Russia and especially China."" Georgia and China now have a strategic partnership and Beijing has invested heavily in Georgian infrastructure. Back on Rustaveli Avenue, teacher Rusudan Lomidze, who has attended the protests every day, says Georgia's fate is inextricably linked to Ukraine's. ""If Ukraine is forced to sign a capitulation agreement, it will be an absolute disaster for us. Our boys are fighting in Ukraine, and they are fighting for both Ukraine and Georgia."" More than 110 Georgian volunteers have been killed fighting for Ukraine, both Georgian citizens and ethnic Georgians, and the Georgian Legion is the biggest contingent of foreign fighters there. The crowds in Tbilisi are smaller than they were a year ago, but several hundred protesters still gather every night despite the risks. Reflecting on her years as a diplomat working towards EU and Nato integration, Nata Koridze now believes ""all of that has crumbled"". ""But the protest embodies an idea. And ideas live through decades, through centuries."""
China US,Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash,2025-11-11T15:44:10.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko,"A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales  told Qian Zhimin she was ""the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed"". After fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures. More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. Investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul. ""If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,"" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. ""Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost."" Qian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after . She moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend. So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property. As Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could ""get rich while lying down"". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping. But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke. Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022. In the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth. Police raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices. But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme. ""The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,"" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC. One of her investo s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day. ""That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,"" he says. He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more. In addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them. ""There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment."" Investors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found. A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends. Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: ""We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance."" The company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready. Lantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly. ""Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,"" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. ""They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world."" A range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said. ""We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?"" The company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to. ""That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,"" Mr Yu says. Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog. But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li. ""Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,"" he remembers. ""We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth. ""She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations."" Mr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them. A Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme. ""The payouts suddenly stopped,"" Mr Yu recalls. ""The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough."" What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police. What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money. Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project. When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told. At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. Qian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a ""Bitcoin pioneer"", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she ""never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her"". Before her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a ""glimpse of sunlight"". The cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a that will start in earnest early next year. There are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain. It is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value. As in other ""proceeds of crime"" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond. Separately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage. The toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC. Still, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine. Mr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said. ""She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst."" Mr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines: ""Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice."""
China US,Two popular gay dating platforms removed from Apple app store in China,2025-11-12T02:55:23.056Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98n2kye01eo,"Apple has confirmed that it has removed two of China's most popular gay dating apps  - Blued and Finka - from its app store in the country following an order from authorities. ""We follow the laws of the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,"" an Apple spokesperson said. The move has raised concerns amongst the LGBT community in the country. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy in Washington and the companies behind both apps for comment. A ""lite"" version of the Blued app remains available on Chinese app stores, according to checks by the BBC. Some other gay and bisexual dating apps are also still available in the country, like Jicco and Jack'd. Blued is one of the most widely-used gay dating apps in China, with tens of millions of downloads. Apple runs a separate app store in China, in accordance with the country's strict internet laws. Popular apps like Instagram and WhatsApp are not available in China. Android device users there use locally adapted versions of the operating system as the Google Play Store is also blocked in China. Members of the LGBT community expressed concerns about the removal of Blued and Finka, with one saying, ""I hope those heterosexual policymakers can understand that love is rare - it's not something shameful or unspeakable."" In 2022, popular US-based gay dating app Grindr was removed from Apple's App Store in China shortly after the Cyberspace Administration of China began a crackdown on content it viewed as illegal and inappropriate. The following year, the Chinese government announced new rules requiring all apps serving domestic users to register for licenses, resulting in a slew of foreign apps being removed online. The online regulator said the rules were designed to ""promote the standardised and healthy development of the internet industry."" Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, though same-sex marriages remain unrecognised. Advocacy groups, including the Beijing LGBT Center and the ShanghaiPride, have ceased operations in China in recent years."

He was also arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, attempted theft of a motor vehicle, theft of a pedal cycle, possession of cannabis and possession of an offensive weapon. Cambridgeshire Police said a 33-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and possession of an offensive weapon. Both men have been released on bail until 16 February. Officers who carried out the warrant found suspected stolen e-bikes, bicycles and a moped. They also seized two zombie-style knives. At the time of the thefts, police said they were investigating .

In total, £2,493,703 from the Office for Students will go to the University of Worcester, which has become the third time in a row the educator has been successful in gaining such funding. According to the university, the £10.5m secured across the three rounds will benefit nearly 3,000 students. Vice chancellor and chief executive, Professor David Green, said: ""This recognition reflects the university's long and successful history of educating highly employable graduates."" The funding will enable the university to create new high-tech digitally enabled simulation rooms, including a specialist midwifery simulation suite. It will also see the purchase of a decommissioned ambulance for training paramedics. Two more highly sophisticated Anatomage tables are also set to be purchased, which show the students life-size 3D digital scans of real people who donated their bodies for science. By increasing its simulation capacity, the university said it would be able to educate even more health professionals for the future. Simon Trickett, chief executive of NHS Herefordshire and Worcestershire, said: ""This is extremely positive news for our local health and care system. ""The University of Worcester already plays a vital role in developing the highly skilled and compassionate health professionals our communities rely on, and this latest funding award will further strengthen that pipeline."""
China US,Two meals for $1: Why China's youth are not spending,2025-11-11T23:12:23.111Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pvlvdve7o,"China is facing a number of economic challenges and its government wants the next generation of consumers to start spending more for the good of all, but it is not having much luck convincing them to do so. Officials say insufficient domestic consumption across much of society is dragging on growth, but recent graduates have more reasons than most to be cautious. Youth unemployment has been hovering at just under 20% for some time, those who have jobs fear they could lose them, and the ongoing property crisis can make the prospect of home ownership seem unreachable, especially in big cities. This uncertainty is encouraging many of China's youth to instead embrace frugality, and social media has been flooded with tips on how people can survive on small amounts of money. ""My work is dedicated to a minimalist way of life,"" one full-time influencer tells the BBC. Videos by the 24-year-old, who goes by the online name Zhang Small Grain of Rice, feature content like her using a bar of ordinary soap for all her personal cleaning requirements, rather than expensive skin cleansing products. She can also be seen walking around shopping areas and showing off various bags and items of clothing which she says are good value because they'll last longer. Companies pay her to feature their goods to her 97,000 followers on the Xiaohongshu site. ""I hope more people will understand consumption traps so they can save. This will reduce their stress and relax them,"" she said. Others focus on budget eating. A 29-year-old using the name Little Grass Floating In Beijing posts videos of himself preparing basic dishes. He says he can have two meals for a little over $1 (76p). ""I am just an ordinary person from the countryside. I have neither a good educational background nor a network of influential contacts, so I must work hard for a better life"", he tells his followers. He works for an online sales firm and claims his extremely modest lifestyle has enabled him to save more than $180,000 over 6 years. Some have asked him online if he would expect his future wife and children to live the same way and what the end goal is. His response: ""I don't know"". China has developed a reputation for being an unstoppable economy, able to ride out the turmoil of the pandemic and US President Donald Trump's trade war. But analysts say it will face significant long-term challenges if it does not boost domestic spending. While the US has a problem with people racking up credit card debt, in China it's the opposite challenge. People are already inclined to save rather than spend and this only increases when there are perceptions of tough times ahead. The Chinese government has been promising for years to increase household consumption but it still accounts for only around 39% of gross domestic product (GDP), as opposed to about 60% in most developed countries. Part of the problem is that today's youth are more pessimistic than in the 1990s and early 2000s. ""Right now, making money is more important to me. I actually need to expand my income sources and cut my costs,"" a young woman in central Beijing tells the BBC. Like many other young people, her salary has been cut, she adds. ""I changed jobs, and it doesn't pay as well. Also, I don't know for how long this new job can sustain me in the future. A bad economic environment like this makes people feel down because we're not earning very much. Finding a job in the first place also isn't easy."" This level of youth unemployment - apart from spreading insecurity - makes it easier for struggling employers to cut wages because workers face a choice of accepting lower pay or diving into a highly competitive job market. A young man, also in his 20s, says there are low-level jobs available but it's hard to find decent work in one's area of expertise. ""Some of my friends are unemployed, still living at home and looking for a job,"" he says. ""They had all kinds of majors at university from financial services to product sales. The economy is a bit off right now. I hope it gets better so we can all have a better life"". And how does he rate the chances of this happening soon? ""I'm not very optimistic,"" he admits. A big concern for China's recent graduates is that the country is making a difficult transition from being a mass producer of cheap goods to a high-tech economy.  And many of these new industries don't require as many workers. Economist George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University,  has been tracking this phenomenon. He cites figures from two big recruitment firms in Beijing showing a high level of university graduates, even with master's degrees, taking jobs as delivery drivers. ""It reflects the skills mismatch between the qualifications which people are leaving higher education with and what's out there in terms of demand for labour,"" he says. ""Of course, that's not being helped by the push to become a champion in robotics and AI because, at least for the time being, this is something of a dampener on job opportunities. Tech isn't really that labour intensive."" Helena Lofgren has been studying China's consumption patterns for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs and believes its economy is relying too heavily on pouring money into preferred industries and focusing on selling products overseas in a time of considerable geopolitical uncertainty. ""People save more than they consume, and you need consumption to make up a bigger share of the economy than it's doing today in China,"" she says. ""You have a very export-oriented and investment driven economy and what we see now is that these parts are too big for the economy to stay healthy."" It is all about economic imbalance. If, for example, China suddenly lost significant export revenue would it have the tools to counter this by financially empowering its enormous domestic population? Some observers have questioned how serious the Communist Party is about increasing domestic consumption. In recent decades, the country has thrived on an investment and export model but that approach is now facing a big challenge: deflation. Would-be customers are often waiting for the price of goods to fall. If a young couple wanted to buy, say, a new lounge suite, it may make sense for them to wait to get a better deal. The longer they, and many more like them, hold off from making big purchases, the more likely companies are to cut prices, leading people to wait even longer for an even better deal. It may seem like a good idea to have cheaper goods, but deflation can force firms out of business and drag on growth overall. This could be countered by somehow fuelling optimism amongst 20 or 30-something consumers. Building a better social safety net or increasing minimum wages might help. There have been some attempts to do this by offering incentives to replace old cars, home appliances and other items but it has not significantly lifted consumption. The influencer Zhang says being cautious with spending runs deep in her country's culture. ""My grandfather's generation was very frugal, very thrifty. It is part of Chinese tradition. For Chinese people to be economical is in their bones,"" she says."

China US,Fracking has transformed an Argentine town but what about the nation?,2025-11-27T00:02:47.835Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewj1e1yk2vo,"Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time. When his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires. There was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off. Then in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed. ""We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre,"" says Mr Jiménez. ""Then the town grew and passed us by."" Fuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo's population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022, In addition to these people who are already permanently settled in Añelo, there are some 15,000 industry workers who sleep in the city every night. This has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through. Last year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres. Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed. Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface. The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron. By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas. This accounts ""for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production"", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official. He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to. Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. ""We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,"" he says. ""All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta."" The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency. ""Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],"" says Mr Gadano. ""This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices."" Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports ""is very important"" for the country, ""especially when two or three years ago we were in the red"". Yet he adds that it won't be ""the panacea"" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt. ""I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,"" he says. ""However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind."" Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors. They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank. ""Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',"" explains Mr Gadano. ""That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players."" The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted. Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection. Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government ""is doing what it has to do and what it can do"". What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. ""All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,"" notes Mr Gadano. This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns. ""We are really losing in the public debate,"" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. ""There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic."" Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. ""When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day."" Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. ""Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs."""
China US,"Buy nothing new this Black Friday, says charity",2025-11-28T06:34:36.406Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2evx9l0y2o,"A reuse charity is asking people to consider second hand this Black Friday as part of an alternative national campaign called Buy Nothing New. Kennet Furniture Refurbiz (KFR), based in Devizes, Wiltshire, collects second hand donations of furniture, homeware and appliances and is part of the national reuse network, a group of organisations which take on items to help others and sell affordably. KFR said it has passed on about 18,000 items, weighing about 340 tonnes over the last year. Daniel Thompson, managing director at KFR, said: ""We've just got to get our message out there. The reuse sector is growing, is rapidly more accepted into society."" He believes the stigma of secondhand is going: ""You've got various websites online where you can buy repurposed items, clothing, etc. I think reuse is on the up. ""Cost of living crisis is extreme at the moment so people don't necessarily have the money to spend on new items for Christmas. ""We are an alternative to that. We are an alternative to the consuming on Black Friday."" There are often Black Friday deals on appliances, but Mr Thompson explained that when they get second hand ones in to clean and refurbish, there is usually very little wrong with them, or can be quickly fixed. He explained that while recycling some items can be a good way to go, the process still produces emissions, so ""by reusing things you're generating far less carbon"". Of the 18,000 goods passed on last year by KFR, more than 7,000 were furniture and nearly 3,800 were electrical. Jen Gale, from Warminster, Wiltshire, runs a blog and podcast called Sustainable(ish) - she and her family have previously done a year of buying nothing new. She said that Black Friday can be useful if someone has a ""specific item in mind, Black Friday can be a real helping hand in terms of some financial savings"". ""I guess it becomes problematic when it's really just encouraging us to consume and to buy things that we didn't know we wanted, we don't necessarily need, and just really, encouraging that very sort of mindless and thoughtless consumption,"" she said. KFR has found itself expanding in a few ways: earlier this year it teamed up with another charity to offer house clearances. It has an arrangement with household recycling centres in Wiltshire and has opened a new location in Swindon too. It is also used by the local councils to provide furniture and appliances for those in need through the household support fund - last year this helped nearly 700 households."
China US,WHO warning over shortage of obesity jabs ,2025-12-01T14:05:41.506Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8n0753zzo,"Fewer than one in 10 people who could benefit from obesity jabs like Wegovy are able to get them, warns the as it releases its first guidance on the drugs. With more than one billion people worldwide now obese, it is calling for more widespread and fairer access to GLP-1 medication. According to projections, more than two billion will be obese by 2030 unless action is taken. High costs, limited production capacity, and supply-chain constraints are major barriers to universal access to the injections that can help people shift significant weight, says WHO. It has already added them to its (for overweight patients with diabetes) that countries are advised to provide. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Our new guidance recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care. ""While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms."" WHO says these drugs, sometime called skinny jabs, represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity, from a ""lifestyle condition"" to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease. It says the drugs can be taken long-term -  for six months or more - but must be prescribed along with advice on diet and exercise, so that people can keep the weight off. Too few people around the world can access them, says WHO. ""Our greatest concern is equitable access,"" said Tedros. Even under the current best projected scenario, the production of GLP-1 therapies could only cover around 100 million people - less than 10% of those who need them, according to the WHO. The guideline calls on countries and companies to expand access, through strategies such as voluntary licensing - where a pharmaceutical company grants permission for others to make affordable non-brand versions of its patented drug. A patent on semaglutide - the core ingredient of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy - is due to expire in several countries in 2026, meaning other drug-makers will soon be free to produce and sell cheap versions in places like India, Canada, China, Brazil and Turkey. WHO says countries must also create healthier environments to promote good health and prevent obesity. GLP-1 drugs mimick a natural hormone to slow digestion, curb appetite and increase feelings of fullness so people eat less. In the UK, the injections are prescription only medicines, which means they can only be prescribed by a healthcare professional for a person who clinically needs it. Some are available on the NHS, but more are sold privately. There is a black market and to be safe people should avoid buying from unregulated sellers such as beauty salons or via social media. People typically start to lose weight within a few weeks of starting on the weekly injections. Research suggests people may within a year of stopping the medication though, as their normal food cravings return. Being overweight or obese increases your risk for developing health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Obesity affects people in every country and was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024, according to the WHO."
China US,'It was part of my childhood' - keeping Ulster Scots heritage alive,2025-11-30T06:14:24.371Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1kpzr152o,"For Gillian Rea, speaking Ulster Scots was a normal part of her childhood and she wants to see others enjoying the culture. A newly-minted tour guide, she has turned her dream into a reality sharing her Ulster Scots heritage with those who wish to learn the history and customs. ""People travel more now, and visit other countries,"" Gillian said. ""But sometimes we don't know what's on our doorstep. ""I think it's really important to explore the culture around you, to know who you are and where you come from in order to see where you're going."" The term Ulster Scots refers to people who migrated from the Lowlands of Scotland to Ulster in the 17th century. Now, it can refer to their heritage and cultural traditions including language, music, and dance. Gillian, who is from Kilwaughter in County Antrim, was one of several people to share readings and stories at an event in Cullybackey as part of Ulster Scots Leid (language) week. Much of Ulster Scots poetry is centred around the home, work, rural living and connection to the land. This event celebrated the weaver poets, also known as the Rhyming Weavers, who wrote in 18th and 19th century Ulster, inspired by the booming linen industry. They earned this name through their style of verse that, when read aloud, sounds like the rhythm a loom makes. An Ulster Scot historian and writer, Dr David Hume, was also at the Cullybackey event. ""At this time Ulster Scots was under pressure and these people were writing bilingually in both English and Ulster Scots,"" he said. Centuries later, Gillian said Ulster Scots is facing a new raft of challenges. ""It's important to keep that language alive, particularly in the world of technology and social media where everything is becoming very much generic with how people speak. ""There's Americanisms coming in, influenced obviously from film, TV and media. ""To counterbalance that, we've got to have more celebrations of the Ulster Scots language. ""We have to keep it alive and rich by passing on these stories."" Similar to Gillian, Davy Moore also grew up in a home where Ulster Scots was part of everyday life. ""There were five of us living in the house with my mum and dad, granny and granda,"" he said. ""We spoke this way all the time. I went to a local primary school, farmer sons and daughters went there and they also spoke like that. ""The teacher didn't correct us, she let us tear away."" It wasn't until grammar school where he felt a changing attitude towards how he spoke. ""People who didn't speak this dialect or language, they would sometimes look down on it as if you were not intelligent, or you were like a redneck."" After taking a creative writing course, Davy has since published his own novel and a collection of short stories. He hopes to one day put together his own modern book of Ulster Scots poetry, in the hope that when he's gone, a younger generation may pick it up. ""I'm not saying for one minute I'm anything like the weaver poets,"" Davy joked Those who attended the Cullybackey event discussed fond memories of growing up and hearing some words and phrases that are now very rarely used. ""Instead of fed up, you'd say I'm scundered with this weather,"" Gillian said. ""If it's cold, you would say I'm foundered."" Another is the phrase ""read up"" (pronounced like red up) which means to tidy up or clean up. Davy added the use of the word ""tovi"", which means to boast. He also enjoyed talking about the use of the word ""thran"" (stubborn or difficult) - something he joked is a common trait of Northern Irish people."
China US,Machu Picchu hit by a row over tourist buses,2025-11-24T00:06:53.799Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g8wrd61zo,"Machu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated. Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes. It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk. He admits that in the past few months ""there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here"". This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport. To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg. Back in September, local protestors angry at what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process to replace Consettur blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks. This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services. A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian. Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start. It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly. ""The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,"" he says. ""This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners."" These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur. Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province. As the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class. Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: ""We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train."" Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site ""was a nightmare for us"". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57. The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally. ""Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages."" He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment. Outside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that ""more needs to be done for the local communities"". She adds: ""We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition."" Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru. ""We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,"" he says. ""If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term."" He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather. ""[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,"" says Mr Gonzalez. ""And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion."" But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years. ""I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to."" Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Torontoy run buses to and from Machu Picchu. ""If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them."""
China US,Teen builds advanced robotic hand from Lego,2025-11-26T06:13:34.165Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g1001z95o,"A teenager has designed and built a fully working robotic hand out of Lego pieces. Jared Lepora, 16, from Bristol, spent about two years on the creation, assisted by his father Nathan who is a professor in robotics at the University of Bristol. ""My dad specialises in making advanced robot hands and I thought these principles were always really cool, so why not make it out of Lego?” Jared said. Nathan hopes the Lego hand, which can pick up variety of objects including fruits and cups, could one day become a ""proper Lego set for other children"" to build. The hand, which is driven by two motors using tendons, has four fingers, each functioning with three joints. Using Lego clutch gears, the mechanics of the fingers move together until they touch an object then stop moving, similar to a human hand. After building the hand and jointly writing an academic paper on it with his father, Jared was invited to give a speech at the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025 conference in Hangzhou, China, and was the youngest speaker there. Nathan said he used to take his son into the lab during summer holidays, where he got familiar with 3D-printed designs while chatting with PhD students. ""And he had the idea of making one out of Lego...maybe he'll become my boss someday,"" he said. ""This genuinely could be of interest to other children to engage with advanced robotics, it's a way in for them. ""If anyone can build the hand, and maybe other children can make design changes, then that's really exciting. ""Wouldn't it be amazing if it could be a proper Lego set for other children, that would be exciting,"" he added."

China US,E-commerce platform breach exposes nearly 34 million customers' data,2025-12-01T04:08:47.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36zwywll02o,"South Korea's largest online retailer, Coupang, has apologised for a massive data breach potentially involving nearly 34 million local customer accounts. The country's internet authority said that it is investigating the breach and that details from the millions of accounts have likely been exposed. The e-commerce platform is often described as South Korea's equivalent of Amazon.com. The breach marks the latest in a series of data leaks at major firms in the country, including its telecommunications giant, SK Telecom. Coupang told the BBC it became aware of the unauthorised access of personal data of about 4,500 customer accounts on 18 November and immediately reported it to the authorities. But later checks found that some 33.7 million customer accounts - all in South Korea - were likely exposed, said Coupang, adding that the breach is believed to have begun as early as June through a server based overseas. The exposed data is limited to name, email address, phone number, shipping address and some order histories, Coupang said. No credit card information or login credentials were leaked. Those details remain securely protected and no action is required from Coupang users at this point, the firm added. The number of accounts affected by the incident represents more than half of South Korea's roughly-52 million population. Coupang, which is founded in South Korea and headquartered in the US, said recently that it had nearly 25 million active users. Coupang apologised to its customers and warned them to stay alert to scams impersonating the company. The firm did not give details on who is behind the breach. South Korean media outlets reported on Sunday that a former Coupang employee from China was suspected of being behind the breach. The authorities are assessing the scale of the breach as well as whether Coupang had broken any data protection safety rules, South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT said in a statement. ""As the breach involves the contact details and addresses of a large number of citizens, the Commission plans to conduct a swift investigation and impose strict sanctions if it finds a violation of the duty to implement safety measures under the Protection Act."" Coupang has faced multiple cyber-security breaches in recent years, including one incident that exposed 460,000 customers' data. Major South Korean organisations have delivered harsh criticism over the latest breach. The editorial board of local newspaper Chosun Ilbo described the incident as ""preposterous"" and called for strong sanctions on firms responsible for leaks of its customer data. Another local media outlet, the Dong-A Ilbo, said the breach is ""the worst personal data leak"" in Korean history. The media outlet questioned how long the incident went unnoticed, adding that it ""means their internal data protection system barely mattered."" The breach marks the latest in a series of cyber-security incidents affecting major South Korean companies this year, despite the country's reputation for stringent data privacy rules. SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile operator, was fined nearly $100m (£76m) over a data breach involving more than 20 million subscribers. In September, Lotte Card also said the data of nearly three million customers was leaked after a cyber-attack on the credit card firm."
China US,Couple's secret to 73-year marriage,2025-12-07T06:57:29.737Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgkvr7d7gdo,"A couple who have been married for 73 years say they have never seriously fallen out. Bill and Olive Miles mark each anniversary by returning to Guildford Cathedral, where they wed on 15 November 1952. The pair, now 95 and 93, met at a youth club when Olive was 16 and Bill was a couple of years older. ""I went with one boyfriend and obviously came back with another one... and I've still got the same one,"" Mrs Miles said. The couple married in front of 132 people when Mrs Miles was almost 20 and Mr Miles nearly 22, having completed his national service. She said in 1952, the ""shell"" of the cathedral was there but it is not the site seen today. It is a building that holds a lot of significance for the couple. Mrs Miles, who was born in Canada, describes Guildford Cathedral as her ""mother home"". ""I was brought up there, I was the first to be confirmed there, and it's just always been my church, it doesn't matter where else I've been,"" she said. In more than seven decades together the couple have travelled extensively, particularly after retiring, to countries including Canada, America, China, India, Nepal, Russia. Mrs Miles says they were also handy on the dance floor. ""We were reasonable dancers,"" she said. ""We did amateur dancing, and we used to go to the Butlins dancing competitions in Brighton quite often, and we maintained our dancing right up until the 60th anniversary."" The couple renewed their vows after 25 and 50 years married, and hold a reception each year to mark the occasion. These events, Mrs Miles explains, have grown smaller. ""As you get to 60 years, to 70 years, because in actual fact, when we look now at the wedding pictures of 132 guests, we are the only two left that are alive.""

China US,More than 100 Aston Martin jobs 'at risk' in St Athan  ,2025-11-07T19:10:05.727Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c874wxdgqv3o,"More than 100 jobs are at risk at the Aston Martin St Athan plant in the Vale of Glamorgan, BBC Wales has been told. The company has blamed losses on US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and weak demand from China. Aston Martin, which started production in south Wales in 2019, said its proposals remain under consultation but no final figures on jobs have been confirmed. The Unite union described the situation as ""devastating"" and said it would begin a consultation with the company to mitigate redundancies. in response to continued challenges in the global macro-economic environment. It said the actions it was taking ""may affect contractor, fixed-term and permanent roles"". Staff production jobs make up the majority of roles being consulted on as well as a number of contractor positions, BBC Wales was told. Andrew Pearson, Unite regional officer, said the news was ""devastating"" for the workforce at Aston Martin. Aston Martin has seen its shares tumble during the year and last month said it faced losing £110m due to the ""global macroeconomic environment"". The Welsh government said it is in contact with Aston Martin and is prepared to to work with the company to offer support to workers following the outcome of the consultation. The current round of potential job cuts follow a decision by the company to cut 170 jobs at St Athan in February."
China US,The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis,2025-11-21T08:03:37.342Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkgxeeyzno,"""Everyone comes in here, it's very cheap. I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries,"" says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. ""It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?"" The store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis. Instead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street. More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid ""challenging trading conditions"". It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year. Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales. These places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops. So why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time? One thing is clear - we're not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed. ""[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops,"" says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. ""[They're doing this] by saying, 'These are things I'm going to buy from you.' ""They know their prices inside out."" Sometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices. But that's not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition. All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers. For pound shops in particular, it's even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn't what it used to be. After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today. Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago. In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above. ""We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,"" he says. ""What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous."" But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right. His Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries. ""We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they're going to buy it,"" he declares. As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers. ""We've got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices,"" he says. So, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of ""extra margin"". If you don't get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel. The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later. ""They just didn't understand the discount business,"" he argues. ""They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it."" Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs. Poundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making. The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. Its owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn't popular with shoppers. ""Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth. But she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan. This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead. The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then. Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents. And shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains. Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes. By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car. But budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis. Not only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of ""extreme discounting"" online to contend with. Today, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There's also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers. ""AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it's growing,"" says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel. Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period. Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul. ""If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you'd find on Temu etc, so if Amazon's doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it's notable,"" says Mr Carroll. ""There's a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come."" There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock. ""As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that,"" she says. ""It's not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody."" The danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market. All this coupled with a ""cost-of-business crisis"" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth. ""You've got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you're at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it's super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there's so many people in that market. ""But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out."" It's not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently. The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too. Savers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland's Peckham store space. OneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs. ""Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing."" As for current trading, he says, he is getting by. ""We're not saying we're earning fortunes of money. We're not - but we're paying our way, and we're just waiting for better times."" His focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading. ""It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas,"" he says. Catherine Shuttleworth reckons that's where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. ""They're a great place to go and deck your house out."" But also, they may be the only place many households can afford to shop. Not everyone likes to shop online, or wants to make the trip to a retail park. ""For some people, budget shopping is a hobby,"" she adds, ""but for others it's an absolute necessity."""
China US,What was agreed on climate change at COP30 in Brazil?,2025-11-22T21:34:13.368Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gqez4lkyo,"Countries have reached a new deal to tackle climate change at the annual UN meeting in Belém, Brazil. But , with no new measures on fossil fuels or deforestation. COP30 was the 30th annual UN climate meeting. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"". ""Parties"" refers to the nearly 200 countries that have signed up to the original UN climate agreement of 1992. COP30 was due to run from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. But the talks overran into Saturday 22 November. World leaders gathered on Thursday 6 and Friday 7 November, before the conference began. The host nation is chosen by participating countries after a nomination from the host region. The conference was held in Brazil for the first time. The choice of Belém, on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, caused significant challenges. Some delegations struggled to book affordable accommodation, leading to concerns that poorer nations could be priced out. The decision to to build a road for the summit also proved controversial. Brazil also continued to grant which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were among those to attend the leaders' summit. UN secretary general António Guterres and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also there. The Prince of Wales, attending on behalf of King Charles, gave a speech calling for countries to come together to tackle the ""fast-approaching"" threats of future climate change. But many leaders were absent, including China's President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. China and the US are the two biggest emitters of planet-warming gases. Delegations from more than 190 countries, including a large number from China, attended the talks, however. The US government did not send any national officials, although some local and state leaders did attend. Politicians and diplomats were joined by scientists, campaigners and journalists. Previous summits have been criticised for the large number of attendees who are connected to the coal, oil and gas industries. Campaigners argue this shows . COP30 took place at a time when global climate targets were under significant strain. In Paris in 2015, nearly 200 countries to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels and to keep them ""well below"" 2C. There is very strong scientific evidence that the impacts of climate change - from extreme heat to sea-level rise - would be far greater at 2C than at 1.5C. But while the use of renewable energy - particularly solar power - is , countries' climate plans have fallen short of what the 1.5C goal requires. Ahead of COP30, countries were supposed to have submitted updated plans detailing how they would cut their emissions of planet-warming gases. However, had done so by the end of October. UN secretary general António Guterres warned that ""overshooting"" 1.5C is inevitable, given how close the target is and how high emissions remain. But he said he hoped temperatures could still be brought back down to the target by the end of the century. Brazil hoped to agree steps to deliver commitments made at previous COPs. At COP28, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2023, about the need to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"". Brazil wanted the talks to secure clearer steps for how countries would achieve this. The idea of such a ""roadmap"" had been backed by dozens of countries, including the UK, but was strongly opposed by others, including those reliant on fossil fuels. In the end, the deal mentioned that existing UAE agreement - but did not strengthen the language around moving away from fossil fuels. Brazil announced its own plan to launch a fossil fuel ""roadmap"" which countries could sign up to - but it sits outside the main deal. At COP29, richer countries committed to give developing nations to help them tackle climate change. But that is far less than poorer countries say they need. That agreement also included an aspiration to raise this to $1.3tn from public and private sources. Ahead of COP30, Brazil published a ""roadmap"" detailing how the $1.3tn goal could be achieved. The COP30 deal called for a trebling of money to help the worst affected nations to adapt to the impacts of climate change, by 2035. But it's not clear how much will come from public versus private sources. And richer nations have consistently undelivered on their cash promises. At the leaders' summit ahead of COP30, Brazil launched the ""Tropical Forests Forever Facility"" - a fund which hopes to raise $125bn (£96bn) from loans and investments. The aim is to try to prevent the loss of tropical forests by rewarding countries who keep their forests standing. But the UK said it would not be committing public money - though could do so in the future and would encourage the private sector to invest. Brazil announced plans to launch a roadmap outlining steps to meet the pledge to halt and reverse deforestation, which was made in COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. But, like fossil fuels, this deforestation roadmap did not make it into the final deal. UN climate talks rely on consensus - all countries present have to agree in order to pass a deal. That can be challenging. Different nations have competing priorities, based for example on their dependence on fossil fuels, economic position or vulnerability to climate change. The backdrop for the talks this year was dominated by the fracturing consensus on tackling climate change, not least from the Trump administration. The US President has pledged to , and roll back green initiatives put in place by his predecessors. Some observers, such as campaigner Greta Thunberg, have accused previous COPs of ""greenwashing"" - letting countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without actually making the changes needed. Significant global agreements have been reached at previous COP sessions, allowing greater progress than national measures on their own. Despite the difficulties of delivering the 1.5C warming limit, the commitment - agreed at COP21 in Paris - has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN. This has helped bring down the level of anticipated warming - even though the world is still not acting at the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals. But the view from many scientists and observers is that the agreements made at COP30 are unlikely to shift the dial much on climate change. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

China US,Obstacle racing 'makes me feel like a superhero',2025-11-11T06:39:32.246Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dr8np8551o,"A Wiltshire athlete who just took bronze at the Obstacle World Championships says the sport makes her feel like she can ""fly like a superhero"". Mila Stanzani, from Trowbridge, told the BBC that getting her first podium finish at the championships in China last month was ""incredible and very surreal"". The sport of obstacle course racing is set to replace the fifth event in the modern pentathlon - which is currently equestrian - at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. But Stanzani hopes it will become a stand alone Olympic event in the future. The 27 year-old took bronze at the inaugural UIPM 2025 Obstacle World Championships held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing. Stanzani competed in the 100m sprint race held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing, which saw athletes race across a course made up of 11 different obstacles similar to what you would see on a Ninja Warrior track. On BBC Wiltshire's Sport at Six show, she said it is ""very thrilling, it's like a puzzle you need to try and solve it, but be fast as well"". Obstacle course racing (OCR) athletes need ""incredible grip strength, precision, accuracy"" according to Stanzani as well as ""a bit of confidence"". She was introduced to the sport when she was 19 years-old and hopes to become an Olympian if the sport does become its own discipline in the future. She is currently the fastest female in the sport in the UK, and said she will ""keep eating my rice and peas and just hope for the best""."
China US,"Shoppers loved the 'fabric queen'. Then, order by order, her story fell apart",2025-12-05T19:02:48.772Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y937w7xl7o,"At 6ft tall and plus-size, shop-bought clothes had never fitted Maree O'Connor well. Sewing offered her a solution - allowing her to use beautiful fabrics to make garments that fit just right. One day, while on the lookout for colourful prints to make new dresses, she spotted some ""amazing"" fabrics being sold online. Enticed by a yellow floral pattern and another black-and-white abstract design, she splashed out $600 (£450, A$900) on three orders. Months later, none had arrived. It was October 2024, and tired of waiting, the legal studies teacher from Melbourne, Australia, decided to set up a Facebook group to try to find out if anyone else was in the same boat. The group exploded. Within two weeks it had drawn hundreds of members, according to Ms O'Connor. She had unearthed a scandal that would consume the sewing world - from China to Europe, to the US. In the group, other sewing enthusiasts detailed how they too had been waiting months - and in some cases years - for fabrics to arrive, while a supplier alleged it was owed tens of thousands of dollars. At the centre of the controversy was globally renowned designer, Nerida Hansen. Her company had grown rapidly during the pandemic, when she made a name for herself selling bold, distinctive fashion prints that set her shop apart from other retailers. Popular with sewists - as members of the sewing community call themselves - around the world, her fabrics often appeared in influencers' Instagram posts. Some newspapers had even dubbed her Australia's queen of fabrics. ""People liked what she was doing and producing,"" said UK-based artist Gabriela Larios, who has worked with Ms Hansen. ""My impression of her was that she was doing something different and new in Australia,"" added Sarah Rowe, another artist who worked with Ms Hansen. ""I was impressed by her, she was formidable."" That's exactly what excited Bergen Anderson, who ordered more than $3,300 (£2,500; A$5,000) of Ms Hansen's fabrics in 2024. She planned to use them to make clothes which she would sell through her US-based children's clothing business. But, as in Ms O'Connor's experience, none of Ms Anderson's goods arrived within the eight-week window that was promised. Instead, she received a number of what she described as ""generic"" emails, saying her orders were soon to be printed and shipped. She also received a number of emails from Ms Hansen saying suppliers were delayed sending goods because of events like national holidays. ""It was every excuse under the sun,"" Ms Anderson said. Frustrated and in search of answers, she too stumbled upon Ms O'Connor's Facebook group. In it, she found customers wondering where their money had gone - and why the company was still accepting orders even though so many people were saying their fabrics hadn't been printed or shipped. Suspicious of Ms Hansen's business practices, Ms O'Connor encouraged customers to request refunds and dispute transactions with their banks. Ms Anderson only managed to get two out of three payments reversed through her bank, meaning she was still $808 (£606; A$1,224) out of pocket. Meanwhile, Ms Hansen had become aware of the Facebook group and contacted Ms O'Connor asking for it to be taken down, claiming that content posted in the group was defamatory - a claim Ms O'Connor rejected. Ms O'Connor said Ms Hansen also offered her an immediate refund if she no longer wished to wait for her goods. ""I got my refund pretty much straight away, because she wanted to shut me up."" But she decided not to shut up - or delete the group. ""She was just going to continue to do what she was doing, and take money from people because people were siloed right, they didn't know what was going on."" In the group people were sounding alarm bells about announcements from Ms Hansen saying she was rebranding, worried about what that would mean for their undelivered orders. Ms Hansen went on to trade under a number of different business names online. By then the group had grown beyond disgruntled customers to also include Nerida Hansen's suppliers. William Shan worked for a supplier in China that sold material to Ms Hansen's company - until, he said, the payments stopped. He was ""helpless"" when he ""accidentally discovered"" the Facebook group, he said. Mr Shan alleged Ms Hansen's firm failed to pay for two fabric shipments worth $52,000 (£39,000; A$78,700) in 2022. He said he initially felt sympathy for Ms Hansen, who he thought ""may have encountered difficulties"". He continued supplying her in the hope it would ""help her recover as soon as possible and collect her [company's] debts"". But he says later orders - worth thousands of dollars - also went unpaid. ""We [trusted Nerida] too much. From 2020 to the end of 2021, Nerida's credit [had] been consistently good. So we did this stupid thing of continuing to supply her,"" Mr Shan said. Mr Shan's company said it had hired numerous lawyers to try to recover the money owed by Ms Hansen's companies, but she and her business associates stopped communicating. The BBC also spoke to 11 artists and illustrators who said they had not been paid for their work with Ms Hansen's brand. Clémence Albertus, based in France, said she had been approached by Ms Hansen at an art fair in Paris about collaborating on fabric prints. Given Ms Hansen was ""really known for her fabrics"", Ms Albertus said she chose to trust her. According to Ms Albertus, Ms Hansen wanted to license one of her designs to be sold in collaboration with a large European fabric retailer called Verhees - an opportunity Ms Albertus didn't want to miss out on. But after sending over her design, a delicate floral print, she heard nothing from Ms Hansen for months. ""I thought Verhees changed their mind, or that the collaboration Nerida x Verhees failed,"" Ms Albertus said. That was until one day in August last year, when she discovered her pattern ""by chance"" for sale on the Verhees website. She said it had been edited in different colourways without her consultation. Ms Albertus contacted Ms Hansen numerous times asking about royalty statements and payment details but is yet to receive any money. ""It has been a real deception,"" she said, adding that she estimates she is owed €2,000-€4,000 (£1750-3500; A$3,500-7,000). Verhees told the BBC it was not responsible for royalty payments owed to designers featured in its collection, and that Ms Hansen was solely responsible for paying these. It added it had now suspended the Nerida Hansen x Verhees collaboration. Not all the artists who spoke to the BBC felt Ms Hansen was totally to blame for the lack of payments from her businesses. Bron Alexander, based in New Zealand, said while she was owed payments for previous projects with Ms Hansen, it was her own fault she hadn't been paid for her Verhees collection work as she'd failed to provide invoices when asked by Ms Hansen's team. Ms Alexander added that she believed Ms Hansen was a ""visionary"" and said she had ""much empathy"" for her financial situation. ""She only ever wanted us [artists] to be successful."" Others insisted business simply wasn't Ms Hansen's forte. ""I truly believe she wanted the best for everybody, I truly believe she wanted to be able to deliver, I truly believe she wanted to be able to pay everybody,"" said Sarah Rowe, an artist who used to collaborate with Ms Hansen and is not owed any money. ""I really believe she had good intentions to do all those things, and I also believe business is not her jam."" Ms O'Connor felt differently. ""I think she's quite intentional in what she's doing,"" she said. ""If she was a disorganised businesswoman she would have quit a while ago."" In September 2025, nearly a year after Ms O'Connor started the Facebook group, a public warning against Ms Hansen and her businesses was issued by the Victoria state consumer rights agency. It was the result of multiple complaints - Ms O'Connor had advised fellow customers on the group to report their experiences to Australian authorities. ""I urge consumers to be wary about purchasing goods from Hansen's online platforms or engaging further with Hansen,"" Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV) director Nicole Rich said. The warning said that over the course of one year, the agency had been contacted more than 120 times by customers claiming to have lost more than $19,800 (£14,900; A$30,000) in purchases. It also said Ms Hansen had operated online under a range of business names, including Indigo Palm, The Kind Merch Co, Nerida Hansen Fabrics, Rebel Quilts, Australian Surface Art Collective, Fabric and Design and Nerida Hansen Print and Textiles. Ms Hansen said this was untrue, denying she used all of these to trade. After the warning was issued, Ms Hansen announced she would be shutting down her businesses by the end of the month to start a new career. But she continued promoting fabric sales on the website domain names Global De-stash and neridahansen.com into November. In a statement to the BBC, Ms Hansen admitted she had made some ""very poor"" decisions relating to her businesses, adding her actions had caused her ""great shame and embarrassment"". She said she had experienced financial difficulties that led to her liquidating her company in late 2022 - before opening a new one in a new name. Following that, she said she fell further behind with orders in 2024, citing supplier issues and business mismanagement, but insisted she was still in control of the situation. ""Even though I mismanaged orders terribly I was steering my own business wheel,"" she said. She had intended to have all orders completed by the end of January 2025, she said, but the creation of the Facebook group had led to a wave of refund requests and bank chargebacks being submitted all at the same time. This left the business overwhelmed, Ms Hansen said, and caused her trading account to be frozen. She still intended to fulfil every order and refund owed to her customers, she stated, but did not currently have the means to do so. She alleged the attention brought to her businesses online by Ms O'Connor's Facebook group had amounted to ""horrific social media harassment"" and defamation. She claimed Ms O'Connor went beyond advocating for justice online. She accused her of encouraging others in the Facebook group to engage in what she describes as amounting to ""digital stalking"" and ""physical stalking"", and that Ms O'Connor ""publicly made deliberate attempts to sabotage [her] livelihood"". Ms O'Connor disputed these allegations saying they were ""outrageous"". ""Customers being persistent and demanding in terms of seeking a refund or product that the vendor had happily taken money for is not harassment,"" she said. Despite everything that has happened, Ms O'Connor is determined to continue sewing - though she insists she will never wear any of Nerida Hansen's designs again. She will continue to fight until Ms Hansen's businesses are shut down, she says. ""Some people are still awaiting justice and we hope that can be achieved."""
China US,PIP withdrawn from amputee over cricket video,2025-12-04T06:40:46.648Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9z00y2p1yo,"The family of a man who lost his leg when he was two years old have asked for a rethink of a decision to strip him of his disability benefits and force him to pay back £36,000. Shaun Rigby from Telford had his Personal Independence Payment (PIP) withdrawn after a video emerged, showing him take part in a game of cricket. But his family said: ""Playing cricket does not negate Shaun's disability; it showcases his determination to lead a fulfilling life despite it."" The Department of Work and Pensions said its decision had been backed by an independent tribunal and PIPs were ""awarded based on how a condition impacts a person's day-to-day needs, as opposed to the condition itself"". In an online petition, Mr Rigby's family said he had ""overcome incredible odds since losing his leg below the knee in a tragic tractor accident when he was just two years old"". They said despite his physical challenges, the 37-year-old had tried to ""live as fully as possible, embracing activities like cricket not only for his own mental and physical health but also to share joyful moments with his family"". Mr Rigby said he used to play for England's disability cricket team, before eventually having to give it up. He said: ""I stopped playing about 2014, just because I couldn't do what I wanted to do, my body was sort of breaking down."" Since then, he said the pain became worse and he was successful in applying for PIP in 2016 and a Motability car three years later. But the DWP decided to withdraw both after their attention was drawn to the video of him playing cricket in 2023. His family said it had been ""a light-hearted community cricket match"". They argued that ""participating in adaptive sports is a well-known form of rehabilitation and psychological well-being for individuals with disabilities"". The decision to strip him of his benefits took away his independence and his ability to care for his family, they said. Mr Rigby said he understood why the DWP had made the decision, but wanted the government department to know he played despite his condition and did it partly to inspire others. He said he would undergo six days of ""torture"" after playing, because of the pain. The family has asked the DWP to reassess his case and reverse the decision. His wife, Lauren, said losing the PIP payments was difficult in itself, but the thought of having to repay the £36,000 was causing the family ""stress and worry"". ""Do they want us to go into poverty?"" she asked. Mrs Rigby added she wanted to push back at some of the negative comments they had received after it was announced he would lose the payment, but that there had been ""nothing but good comments"" since the online petition was launched. The DWP said: ""Following Mr Rigby's appeal, where he was able to challenge his benefit entitlement, an independent tribunal agreed with DWP's decision."" It also said that every PIP claim was different, because of individual circumstances  ""including age and the ability to manage a condition without supervision or assistance"". Mr Rigby is waiting to hear what the weekly repayments will be on the £36,000 and believes it could be up to £35 a week. The DWP said it was committed to working with anyone struggling with repayment terms."
China US,Sale of Daily Telegraph collapses after US firm pulls out,2025-11-14T14:43:29.958Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993drmj1dyo,"US investment group RedBird Capital has pulled out of a deal to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph for £500m. RedBird had a previous attempt to buy the Telegraph rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi's IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family. A law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals. The new bid complied with that rule, but it is understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review. A spokesman for the group said: ""RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group. ""We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and we will work hard to help secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers."" Sources close to RedBird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest. RedBird itself has faced questions over the extent of investment it has received from China and Gulf based investors. An IMI Group spokesperson said its ""priority has been to end the uncertainty and secure the Telegraph's long-term success"" and that it remained in contact with ""interested parties"" on a deal. It said it remained committed to completing a sale, while co-operating with the government and regulators. RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market. Among other investments, RedBird Capital owns the Italian football team AC Milan. The Daily Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the RedBird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph's previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers."

""It's fantastic for all of those people that are going to get more money in their pocket, he said. ""I heard the Chief Secretary [to the Treasury] said it is a slight increase.  That is not a slight increase, it is a big increase. It is going to cost me £70-£80,000 a year,"" Mr Ely claimed. Prices at Toast almost certainly will have to go up, but he said there is a limit to how much people will hand over for a cup of coffee. Matt Kimber is standing on his bustling Basildon factory floor. ""I'm genuinely more positive than I was"" he said after the Budget Mr Kimber is managing director of family-run metal works company GK Engineering. It makes steel structures like staircases for NHS hospitals and new apartment blocks.  The firm employs 50 people and has a £9m turnover. ""We've seen some good things about public spending in our sector. There's some good things about apprenticeships. We are not overly impacted by minimum wage.  They are a skilled workforce so we are above minimum wage,"" the 36 year-old boss said. But Mr Kimber feels there is still ""some uncertainty"" as a lot of the measures announced won't start for a couple of years. Darren Sharp is one of the welders at GK Engineering and he feels in the past five years things have got financially tighter. The Chancellor said ""cutting the cost of living"" was one of her three priorities in the Budget - along with cutting NHS waiting times and the cost of debt. But after this Budget, Mr Sharp said: ""For me personally, it's not going have that much of an effect. ""I don't think they have been spending money in the right places. I would like to see them spend more on defence with threats from Russia and China."" He has older children so will not be affected by the two-child benefit cap being scrapped but the 54 year-old welcomed the freezing of prescription charges. The owner of the Dragonfly Lounge in Colchester, an LGBTQ+ bar and community space, was uncertain of its future pre-Budget. Jo Palmer-Tweed said Rachel Reeves' second Budget was ""a mixed bag"". ""I'm very pleased about the business rates decision for hospitality because that is potentially quite a big cut.  That was very pleasing,"" she said. The Chancellor announced that there will be permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses from next year in properties with an annual rental value less than £500,000. The Dragonfly Lounge opened earlier this year and its property hasn't been valued yet but Ms Palmer-Tweed is hopeful it will lead to a reduction. She said they will be ""impacted"" by the rise in national living wage and the freezing of the income tax thresholds. ""The income tax hikes are going to impact different parts of our customer base. ""Overall for us in the shorter term [the Budget] has been good for us. But in the longer term it's going to really depend in how it shakes out in terms of customer spending,"" the owner of the Dragonfly Lounge said. Before the Budget, Ms Palmer-Tweed, also known as Mamma Dragonfly, was worried whether they would survive next year as a safe space for the LGBQ+ community in Colchester to go out at night.  After the Budget she is more confident."" ""It improves our chances in the longer term. I think it is a really good start for Rachel Reeves but I think we could do more"". So a photo opportunity at the Dragonfly Lounge for the Chancellor might find some raising their glasses to her.  But if growth drags, taxes bite into disposable incomes and customers sashay away from the night time economy Rachel Reeves may face a tough crowd here."
China US,Marsh solar park plans questioned by campaigners,2025-11-27T06:00:25.703Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrvjkr1jxo,"Campaigners against proposals to build three large-scale solar parks claim the government's ambition to treble the amount of solar capacity in the UK is ""fundamentally flawed"" and ""damaging"". Amanda Farrant, who lives near the proposed Shepway Energy Park, says if plans are approved it would be ""like living in the middle of a massive, great big solar power station"". Three solar parks being put forward for Romney Marsh in Kent are at various stages of planning and consultation. None have yet been submitted to the planning inspectorate. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said solar contributed in 2024. Opponents to the Romney Marsh plans they will damage unique and fragile habitats and take up productive farm land. Ms Farrant, who formed the Hands Off Our Marsh campaign, believes there are better options to solar energy calling it ""too intermittent"" and that the government's solar ambitions are generating a solar ""gold rush"". ""It's all about speed and getting it done quickly,"" she claimed, adding the approach could lead to ""devastation"" of the rural environment. There is scepticism from some about the effectiveness of solar panels. Prof Tony Day, an independent energy consultant and visiting professor at London South Bank University, said the government target would only deliver 2-3.5% of national energy needs in the depths of winter. ""Even in the peak of summer the average monthly power output is around one fifth of headline capacity figure,"" Prof Day said. ""No other generation asset would be considered viable with this type of delivery or energy risk profile."" The government's hopes the UK will have 45-47GW of solar capacity by 2030. Proposals for a 500MW South Kent Energy Park in Old Romney would see more than 1,400 acres turned over to solar. Plans for the 200MW Shepway Energy Park, near Newchurch, see an area made up of six sites covering more than 1,000 acres. South Brooks Solar Farm's 500MW plan is made up of several sites potentially over more than 2,700 acres. If approved they would be three of the biggest solar parks in the country. Due to the size of the proposals they are classed as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) and the decision to approve or reject the plans is made at a national level, not by local councils. Since coming to power Labour has approved 11 NSIP solar parks around the UK. Colin Woollard, who lives and works on Romney Marsh, bought 256 solar panels from China in 2023 to power his motorsport engineering manufacturing business, with a 140KW capacity. He says when he bought them he was sold the idea that it would work all year round. ""It just doesn't,"" he said. Mr Woollard said on a cloudy day in November they only generated 21 kilowatts, which he said was ""basically seven kettles of water"". He questioned the ability to ""run a country"" on such an inefficient model. The government says solar offers potential to boost the country's energy independence, bring down bills and tackle the climate crisis. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""Solar is one of the cheapest forms of power and – alongside upgrades to the electricity grid – will help us get us off fossil fuels and delivering energy security so we can get bills down for good. ""All projects are subject to rigorous planning processes, and the views of the local community must be taken into account."" The three developers of the proposed sites said they had consulted residents and that the feedback would help to inform the projects."
China US,"We will be hammered in the budget, says 64-year-old",2025-11-21T06:03:47.304Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8e7zv510no,"A man in his sixties with disabilities says he feels he will ""get hammered"" whatever happens in the Budget announcement on 26 November. Andy Watson, 64, lives in Stotfold, Bedfordshire, and has serious mobility problems. He has also had a liver transplant and two types of cancer. He says he was hoping that some of the in the budget do not turn out to be true. When sitting with a cigarette in his mouth in the room where he spends most of his life, Andy Watson does not look like a survivor. But somehow, he says, he is still ""living and breathing"". After receiving a lung transplant 22 years ago, he was diagnosed with lung cancer eight years ago. Bowel cancer followed in 2022, along with back problems. ""My spine is poking into the spinal cord,"" he said, ""so walking is very difficult, very very painful. ""I've been receiving injections in the spine for the last few years, but you're only allowed so many of them and they stopped."" Mr Watson says he is on a waiting list for hospital treatment, but in the meantime  his mobility is ""lousy"" so he is ""stuck in the house"" apart from visits to a nearby coffee shop. ""Whatever happens in the budget,"" he said, ""we know we're going to get hammered. ""I'm just hoping [the government] are going to breach their manifesto and there's a call to arms by everybody for them to have another election. ""It's gone beyond the point of saying 'yeah, they've just got in, they've got to find their feet'."" Mr Watson believes the economy has only got worse over the past 18 months and the government is ""just investing more and more money on immigrants"". He believes paying £49.18 a week to asylum seekers has resulted in the government being forced to consider new unpopular charges in the budget. He also spoke against the government housing migrants in hotels as the accommodation was ""still a hotel, still a nice little holiday joint"". concluded that while the media and politicians ""depict people seeking asylum as living in luxury...  the reality could not be more different."" The government said it would , saving the taxpayer billions of pounds. Mr Watson says pensioners are suffering financially despite ""contributing to the country all these years - but Mr Starmer don't think about that, it's a joke"". The state pension is currently £230.25 per week while the allowance for an asylum seeker goes down to £9.95 per week if their accommodation supplies meals. Mr Watson said his own income, which is made up of a Personal Independence Payment, Employment and Support Allowance and a mobility allowance, was ""a couple of hundred pounds a week to live on [and I] contribute towards running a house, buying food"". Mr Watson said: ""[The government is] on about taxing your mileage. ""Scrap the road tax - just put it on the petrol [so] we're all paying equal."" A spokesperson for the Treasury said Vehicle Excise Duty was forecast to raise approximately £9.1bn in the current financial year, which would go towards funding public services. Mr Watson would like some measures in the budget to give him a little more income: ""I'm very lucky, my wife has retired, so she has a pension. ""She pays the majority of the bills and the running costs, other than that it's very, very tight. ""It would be lovely to be off on nice holidays and all the rest, but you can't do it."" He said he enjoyed a ""couple of little mini-breaks a year"" with his wife Liz in the UK. Before his health forced him to give up his job eight years ago, Mr Watson was running a shop selling mobility aids. ""We miss it,"" he says, ""we miss the banter - it was lovely to help people."" Although he has left the world of business behind, he has a keen interest in what owners of small businesses are going through. At the moment, bosses have to register for VAT if their turnover over 12 months is greater than £90,000. The think tank, The Resolution Foundation, has suggested the government drops the threshold to just £30,000 to increase competition, but Mr Watson is not impressed. ""What a joke,"" he said, ""I know a few shopkeepers, they're closing earlier now, because they are frightened to death of going over and into the VAT."""
China US,Shock in Cameroon as 74-year-old opposition firebrand dies in detention,2025-12-01T17:38:50.481Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9204y4w5o,"Left-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced. Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election. Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. . No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied. According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend. ""We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,"" he said. He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary. Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details. ""The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,"" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October. Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party. He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death. Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as ""the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame"" that burned for democratic emancipation. Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation. ""One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,"" Muna said. According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection. ""He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,"" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as ""illegal"". In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and . His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online. Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces. Ekane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate. Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate. At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN. This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were ""firing at point-blank range at the people"". The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing."
China US,The contradiction at the heart of the trillion-dollar AI race,2025-11-19T13:52:41.501Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvynlxqdyo,"But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. ""AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on,"" he insists. ""It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions."" But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a ""sudden correction"" in global financial markets, saying ""market valuations appear stretched"" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that ""there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now"". Asked whether from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us."" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these ""inflection points"": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. ""Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence."" But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is ""palpably exciting"" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: ""It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… ""So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: ""restricted"". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term ""AI factories"" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: ""I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!"" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: ""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough."" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. ""I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,"" he said. But he also said: ""What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure."" Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. ""I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,"" he told me. ""Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it."" But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: ""truth matters"". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? ""I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,"" he adds. ""I think that will have consequences."" Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about ""irrational exuberance"". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century."

Author Sylvia Vetta is one of the forces behind the free Oxford Indie Book Fair which takes place on Sunday at the University of Oxford Examination Schools. She described the decline in reading enjoyment as ""a catastrophe"", as National Literacy Trust report shows the reading crisis persists. Oxford Brookes University chancellor and author Paterson Joseph, who will be part of the fair for a second year, said ""we just need to be clever about how we deliver books to children and how"". Mrs Vetta said that at seven, she would walk a mile and a half to her local library every Saturday. ""I would take Enid Blyton's The Famous Five, but I also took out books on China, on India."" Mr Joseph describes himself as ""a serial bunker-off"" at school but books were ""a wonderful escape"". ""Not only are you learning a greater vocabulary, you're also understanding worlds that are very different to yours."" But shows reading for pleasure at ""its lowest in 20 years"". It is based on 114,970 responses on the reading habits of children and young people aged 5 to 18 from various backgrounds. With just 1 in 3 respondents saying they enjoyed reading in their free time in 2025, that marks ""a 36% decrease in reading enjoyment levels since we started asking about this in 2005"". ""I think we just need to be clever about how we deliver books to children and how,"" said Mr Joseph, who has an acting career in TV and film. ""How we get them interested in in the tactile nature of of having a copy in their hands and the beauty of a book, its colour, its weight, its smell, everything about it should be a delight."""

China US,Cameroon's opposition leader in The Gambia after fleeing for his safety ,2025-11-24T11:26:59.659Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dyjn1mne5o,"Cameroonian opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who is contesting the outcome of the presidential election, has fled to The Gambia for his safety, The Gambian government has said. Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he is the legitimate winner of the 12 October election, alleging that the result was rigged to give President Paul Biya, 92, an eighth term. The Gambian information ministry said on Sunday that Tchiroma Bakary arrived on 7 November and was allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds. Cameroon's government had threatened to put him on trial for allegedly inciting violent post-election demonstrations. He denied the allegation, and blamed the security forces for a crackdown on protesters. The government put the number of people killed in post-election violence at 16, but other organisations have given a higher death toll. Tchiroma Bakary has repeatedly promised to resist Biya's government until his ""victory"" in the election is recognised. Biya, the world's oldest president, has been in power for 43 years, and was declared the winner with 53.7% of the vote amid allegations of fraud. Tchiroma Bakary, who served in Biya's government for many years, came second with 35.2%. His resistance tactics have included calling for street protests and ""ghost town"" operations aimed at bringing cities and towns to a standstill. Until The Gambian government confirmed his presence, his whereabouts had remained a mystery although there was speculation that he had fled to another country in the region. ""He is being hosted temporarily in The Gambia purely on humanitarian grounds in the spirit of African solidarity and for the purpose of ensuring his safety while discussions continue to pursue a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the post-electoral tensions in Cameroon,"" The Gambian government said in a statement. The Gambian authorities said the country would not be used as a ""base for subversive activity against any state"". The BBC has reached out to the Cameroonian government for comment. Reacting to the announcement, The Gambia's main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) criticised the government for withholding the announcement of Tchiroma Bakary's arrival until Sunday. It said it raised ""serious questions about transparency, accountability, and respect for The Gambian people's right to know what actions are taken in their name"". However, the party said it was proud that Tchiroma Bakary could find ""safe sanctuary"" in The Gambia, adding that it was fully aware of how ""despotism operates and how dissenters are treated""."
China US,Profits fall at IT firm Kainos despite rising revenue and global expansion,2025-11-10T11:00:19.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4zz47ew0o,"IT firm Kainos, one of Northern Ireland's largest businesses, has made £32m in pre-tax profit in the first half of the financial year. Although revenues rose to £196.1m, increased costs from national insurance rises, investments and temporary staffing reduced profits by 16% on the previous year. The company is set to take four floors of the £40m office building currently under construction at Bankmore Square as its new headquarters, due to open in September 2027. Kainos employs more than 3,100 people globally, offering digital services to large institutional clients like public bodies and the NHS, as well as finance and HR products in partnership with US firm Workday. AI is the hottest topic in both technology and financial markets, with the value of individual companies in the sector . Kainos CEO Brendan Mooney told BBC News NI that AI was already an important part of the company's own operations. ""That's everything from how we do our software engineering to how we are able to do prototyping for clients in ever quicker timeframes. Some 65% of what we do on the engineering side is now supported by AI tools and we see productivity improvements around that."" While a lot of tools for clients are still at the ""experimentation"" stage, some narrower AI tools have already been rolled out by the company, including a chat bot for Leeds City Council intended to provide guidance for those in financial distress. Other clients, dealing with sensitive data or live systems, are more hesitant. ""Some of our clients will be the likes of the Home Office, the Passport Service, the Ministry of Defence. Some clients, I think rightfully, are cautious about - you give the model your data, there's no guarantee you get it back or it doesn't go somewhere else."" Forty-three percent of the company's half year revenue came from its international operations, with 120 new employees in Canada and entry to new markets in Australia and New Zealand. Brendan Mooney said that trend is likely to continue. ""At our current pace, in two years' time, the majority of our business will be generated elsewhere – even while our UK business grows as well. The opportunities are global for what we do."" Another key growth area for the company is in the health care sector. Revenues from the health sector increased by 33% to £29.6m with the company providing services to research bodies, as well as the NHS. With the Chancellor announcing as one of her priorities ahead of the Autumn Statement, there is likely to be an increased focus on boosting productivity and digital accessibility in the health service."
China US,Typhoon moves away from Philippines after killing two,2025-11-10T03:16:42.357Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykp36ewkzo,"A weakened Typhoon Fung-wong is now passing over the South China Sea and expected to head to Taiwan, after leaving two people dead in the Philippines. Some 1.4 million in the Philippines had been preemptively evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall on Sunday as a super typhoon, carrying winds of 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). It hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT) and weakened to a typhoon hours later. Fung-wong comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left nearly 200 people dead. Philippine authorities are reporting less severe damage than expected - though a number of communities are still cut off by the floods. By daybreak, the winds from Typhoon Fung-wong which had howled all night had died down, and people came out to see the damage. There was plenty of damage to buildings, but good preparation appears to have prevented a repeat of the casualties seen after Kalmaegi hit the central Philippines last week. The country's meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and ""high risk of life-threatening"" storm surges from the ""very intense"" typhoon. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, buildings were secured and residents in low-lying and coastal areas had been urged to move to higher ground. At a shelter in central Aurora, parents brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. ""We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,"" Jessa Zurbano had earlier told the BBC. Another evacuee Patry Azul said: ""Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe."" The winds Fung-wong brought were not as strong as in some previous storms, and its destructive power quickly weakened after it made landfall. Two deaths were reported, according to the civil defence office: one person drowned, while another woman was found dead under debris in Catbalogan City. Two others were injured. Still, many neighbourhoods have been flooded, and some are now isolated from the rest of the country after roads and bridges were cut by the high water levels. Aurora officials told local media on Monday that four towns have been blocked. Power is down in much of the main island of Luzon. The Filipino government had declared a state of calamity across the country in preparation for Typhoon Fung-wong and in the wake of Kalmaegi. This gives government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services. Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year, left at least 204 people dead in the Philippines, while more than 100 are missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones. About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide. However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - . That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding. Are you in the Philippines? If so you can"
China US,Why India caps pollution reading at 500 when the air is far more toxic,2025-11-16T00:00:03.510Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6jgg0180o,"For millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge. For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days. This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500? India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as ""severe"" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the So why was that threshold introduced? ""It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,"" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation. But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher. ""International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,"" says Mr Beig. ""That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms."" The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment. Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms. Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds. ""WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,"" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading. In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board. Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air. ""The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,""  says Mr Pathak, adding that ""sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government"". According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology. ""National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,"" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, ""now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase"". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling."
China US,Vicar leads push to honour Chinese WW1 labourers,2025-11-11T06:14:45.180Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g2kz3rn6o,"A British-Chinese vicar is leading an effort to get the contribution of 140,000 Chinese labourers who helped the Allies in World War One formally remembered at St Paul's Cathedral. The Reverend Mark Nam, of St John the Evangelist in Woodley, Berkshire, first learned about the Chinese Labour Corps in an online talk during the Covid pandemic and needs £15,000 for the memorial. He said it was now his ""passion… so that my children's children see there were people like us, of Chinese heritage, who stood shoulder to shoulder with British troops at their hour of need"". The men were recruited from the Chinese province of Shandong to do manual work behind the frontlines from 1916. Mr Nam attended the online talk by the , which promotes Chinese culture with the aim of fostering better understanding between people of Chinese origin and those from other ethnic backgrounds, both in the UK and worldwide. ""As I started listening, oh my gosh, something was rising up in me,"" he said. ""I just didn't know about [the men]. By the end, I felt moved to action. ""A lot of people in this group are quite elderly. Hearing one gentleman say 'I hope I can see something established before I die' really touched me."" Having publicised the project online, he was approached by the cathedral and Mr Nam said an earmarked place for the memorial is an impressive spot. ""I thought it might be down a corridor, by the toilets or something,"" he said. ""It's within almost touching distance of Lord Nelson's tomb. It's great we have got the place. ""I suppose that is the easy bit. The hard bit is that I have to pay for it. ""I'm a parish priest, a vicar. I don't have money sloshing around in my cassock."" He is raising funds online to pay for the memorial, which he said would mark the men's contributions appropriately. ""I'm British-Chinese and Britain is my home and I want to see something on our shores,"" he added. ""France and Belgium have had memorials for several years and I would love to see Britain catch up and do this properly."""
China US,Our dogs' diversity can be traced back to the Stone Age,2025-11-13T19:00:29.556Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7j89ykro,"If you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable. But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought. ""When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,"" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study. She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago. In a paper , this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution. They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives. This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads. Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age. ""It's really surprising,"" she said. ""And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this."" Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle. This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication. Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food. Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near. As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: ""It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see. ""It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one."" For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In , a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China. They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years. I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back."
China US,Google boss says trillion-dollar AI investment boom has 'elements of irrationality',2025-11-18T12:16:04.197Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo,"Every company would be affected if the AI bubble were to burst, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet has told the BBC. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an ""extraordinary moment"", there was some ""irrationality"" in the current AI boom. It comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry. Asked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning. ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us,"" he said. In a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment, , and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs. The interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense. Alphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI. A particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation. As valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment. It has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed. This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds. In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of ""irrational exuberance"" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can ""overshoot"" in investment cycles like this. ""We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,"" he said. ""I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry . But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own ""full stack"" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence. The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was , committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years. Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop ""state of the art"" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London. For the first time, he said Google would ""over time"" take a step that is being pushed for in government to ""train our models"" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI ""superpower"" after the US and China. ""We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,"" Mr Pichai said. However, he also warned about the ""immense"" energy needs of AI, which made up , according to the International Energy Agency. Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,"" he said. He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies. ""The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,"" he said. AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it ""the most profound technology"" humankind had worked on. ""We will have to work through societal disruptions,"" he said, adding that it would also ""create new opportunities"". ""It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,"" he said. Those who do adapt to AI ""will do better"". ""It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools."" to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. ."
China US,From florist to drone maker: How the weapon became so mainstream,2025-11-14T22:24:18.224Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3ydv2ygro,"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is often described as the world's ""first drone war"". It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements. Now, she makes drones for use against the Russians. ""It was just an obvious decision for me,"" she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. ""I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military."" Ms Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed. ""I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones,"" she recalled. ""So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them."" These days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon. Combat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact. Before 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones. ""This has been the first full-blown drone war,"" says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare. ""There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They've become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians."" And not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan. ""You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power."" Ms Pettyjohn says. The world's biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Europe, Portugal's Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany's Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due in Swindon in southwest England at the end of November. Meanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be on new military drones. ""The sector is growing really quickly,"" said Mike Armstrong, Stark's managing director for the UK. ""I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we've seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon."" The growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down. Anti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport. Oleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company. ""We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones,"" he says. Since 2022, DroneShield's share price has ""We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us,"" Mr Vornik adds. As well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China's use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs. Munin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army. ""We're building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones,"" he says. ""It's a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it's coming in."" Experts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI). At the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger. But Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. ""That is going to be the next real shift. ""Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate."" In the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line. ""I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers. ""But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture."""
China US,Guinness maker appoints former Tesco boss to stem flagging sales,2025-11-10T13:53:50.155Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4021v7wepo,"A former Tesco boss has been appointed to the top job at Guinness-owner Diageo, as the biggest drinks firm in the world seeks to turn around its flagging sales. Sir Dave Lewis will take over the brewing giant on 1 January, after former chief executive Debra Crew quit in the summer after two years in charge. The firm has been battling weaker sales across its range despite a growth in Guinness sales, with shares recently falling to a 10-year low. Following the announcement of Sir Dave's appointment on Monday, Diageo's share price rose 7% in early trading. Diageo owns well-known brands including Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Captain Morgan rum, but has seen sales weakening in key markets, in particular the US and China. Sir Dave was chief executive of Tesco for six years until 2020, and before that had spent nearly 30 years at consumer goods giant Unilever. He will leave his current role as chairman of health firm Haleon. Diageo said its board felt Sir Dave had extensive chief executive experience and proven leadership skills ""that is right for Diageo at this time"". ""The market faces some headwinds but there are also significant opportunities,"" said Sir Dave. ""I look forward to working with the team to face these challenges and realise some of the opportunities in a way which creates shareholder value."" Diageo saw its operating profits decline to £3.2bn in the year to June - around 28% lower compared with the same period the year before - with net sales down 0.1%. It said there was ""clearly much more to do"" in what it called a challenging year, citing ""pressure on consumers"". Last week, Diageo forecast net sales growth would be flat to slightly down in the year ahead due to a ""weaker US consumer environment"" and lower sales across China. Rising inflation has led to people tightening their spending in recent times, with consumers cutting back on drinking and eating out. The firm has also been battling with changing drinking habits from younger people, who are opting to drink less alcohol than previous generations. ""Dave Lewis needs to put Diageo back on track quickly,"" said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. ""His style is to listen closely to customers and suppliers and work out what's gone wrong. The focus will be on repair work, not long-term growth."" Mr Coatsworth said the new boss earned the nicknam ""Drastic Dave"" while at Unilever ""because of his ability to make bold decisions without simply tinkering at the edges"". ""At Tesco, he walked away after saying his job to stabilise the business was done, rather than sticking around to take the business to the next level. One might suggest the same approach will apply to Diageo."" Sir Dave will replace Nik Jhangiani - Diageo's chief financial officer who has been acting as interim chief executive since Ms Crew resigned in July."
China US,Funeral company to move after business premises sold,2025-11-20T05:58:43.627Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4xldplr4o,"A village's funeral director said he had been ""shocked"" after learning his leased premises had been sold without his knowledge. Richard Stebbings Funeral Service, which has operated in Impington, Cambridgeshire, for 21 years, has been purchased by a council-owned company. This Land, owned by Cambridge County Council, bought the family-run business alongside a village shop in the hope of building 28 apartments on the site. Mr Stebbings said the change ""just came as a shock"" and said he now does not ""know what to do or where to go"". This Land said it proposed to deliver a ""sustainable residential-led development"" to include 28 apartments, a retail unit, landscaping, and amenity space. A spokesperson for the business said: ""Discussions with the two current commercial tenants on the site remain ongoing and it is our aim to retain a productive dialogue with them as the plans for the site progress."" Mr Stebbings, who started working in the profession in 1966, said: ""We had a meeting and we thought we were still part of what was happening, but unfortunately we weren't. ""They said, 'I am afraid you are going to have to go' and I am just completely lost now."" This Land on Cambridgeshire County Council-owned land in 2016, but is yet to turn a profit. The authority has had to play down fears over about £120m it has loaned This Land. The business said it recognised ""the important role"" the funeral company had in the community and said it was ""committed to working closely with them as they explore options for the future of their businesses"". Mr Stebbings said he had received lots of support from his customers. ""Everything has to be done in a dignified way when you're caring for somebody's loved one - they need to be treated with respect."""
China US,At least 65 dead and hundreds missing after fire engulfs Hong Kong tower blocks,2025-11-27T12:52:42.992Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg165d7ppvo,"At least 65 people have been killed in a huge fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong - the city's deadliest blaze in more than 70 years. Some residents remain trapped inside the buildings, with more than 270 people unaccounted for, while 70 people are injured. Hundreds of firefighters have been tackling the blaze, which is now largely under control at all of the affected buildings at Wang Fuk Court. The housing complex had been undergoing extensive renovations when the fire began. The exact cause is unclear but police say materials on outside of the buildings may have facilitated its spread. Three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. The blaze broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, with flames and thick clouds of grey smoke seen billowing from the towers, dominating the city's skyline. By 18:22 local time, officials upgraded the fire to a level five - the most serious category. Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among those killed in the blaze. He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost. Ten other firefighters are also injured, according to the fire department. ""I am devastated,"" 65-year-old Jason Kong told news agency Reuters. ""I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do."" He said a neighbour had called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris and the risk posed from collapsing scaffolding, has hampered rescue efforts, but the fire department has so far rescued 55 people. ""Despite the complex conditions at the scene, the firefighters' rescue efforts will not stop,"" Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee told a news conference on Thursday evening. Mesh material and plastic sheets which were found on the outside of the buildings are not believed to be fireproof, while Styrofoam was also found on the buildings' windows. These materials may have allowed the fire to spread faster, police said. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" a police spokesperson said. Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption has said it will launch a criminal investigation over the renovation works. Fire safety expert Prof Jiang Liming, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said he believed the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks may have also helped the fire grow. Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight across Hong Kong - a city known for its high-rise buildings - and is widely used in construction. Lee said he had arranged inspections of ""all housing estates undergoing major repairs"" to check the ""safety of scaffolding and building materials"". He added that the government was considering a review of bamboo scaffolding and whether they should be replaced by metal frameworks. ""The government will stand united with all Hong Kong people, and we are confident that we will be able to get through this together,"" he said. Campaigning for the city's Legislative Council election on 7 December has been suspended. Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po district was built in 1983 and consists of eight tower blocks providing 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built. Some residents told local media that alarms did not sound when the fire began, and that they struggled to leave when the elevators stopped working. Kiko Ma, 33, who has an apartment in the housing complex, told the BBC that some of the fire alarms had been turned off during the renovation, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to enter and exit the buildings. There were also reports on Wednesday night of blasts being heard from inside the buildings, and of fire hoses struggling to reach the upper levels of the 31-storey towers. Police have evacuated nearby buildings, and several temporary shelters have been opened. One of the shelters, located across the road from the housing complex, was deemed unsafe as the fire raged, and evacuees were directed to another further away. Outside one of the shelters, a woman was seen holding her daughter's graduation photo as she searched for her family. ""She and her father are still not out yet,"" the 52-year-old told Reuters. ""They didn't have water to save our building."" An officer at a temporary shelter earlier told news agency AFP that it was unclear how many people were unaccounted for because residents were still trickling in late into the night to report missing family members. As dawn broke on Thursday morning, small fires remained visible from the outside of the still-smouldering buildings. Meanwhile, people have been turning up with food and clothes for displaced residents. Several well-known Chinese businesses have pledged donations to support relief efforts. Alibaba Group, which owns e-commerce platforms Temu and Taobao, said it would give HK$20 million ($2.6m; £1.9m). There is a large evacuation zone around the fire, roads are closed and more than 30 bus routes have been diverted, Hong Kong's Transport Department says. Thirteen nearby schools have suspended lessons, education officials said. China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported. Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record happened in 1948, which killed 176 people and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse."
China US,Mick Jagger makes surprise visit to his old school,2025-11-19T18:36:55.535Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3k3wejkkvo,"Sir Mick Jagger has advised the next generation of musicians to ""work really hard and not give up"" during a surprise visit to his former school. The Rolling Stones frontman visited The Mick Jagger Centre at Dartford Grammar School in Kent on Wednesday to mark the facility's 25th anniversary. The 82-year-old thanked music teachers at the performing arts centre who ""inspired children and young people in their musical careers"". Sir Mick told the BBC that young people aiming for a music career needed ""a lot of luck"" and to ""work really hard at it and not give up"". He said that ""music wasn't much of a career"" when he was growing up, but added: ""That all changed very, very quickly in the early 60s and I got on that bandwagon."" He opened The Mick Jagger Centre, home to the Dartford Music School and Dartford Symphony Orchestra, in 2000. The centre launched a programme of events in October to mark its 25th anniversary. Sir Mick said that visiting his former school ""brings back a lot of memories and it's nice to see the kids seem happy"". According to The Mick Jagger Centre, the singer funds its Red Rooster project offering free music tuition, including in local primary schools. ""If you can express yourself through song, drama, art, dance – all these things are important,"" Sir Mick added. ""My involvement's been honestly pretty minimal in a real way, but I do feel connected to it, and I think all the people involved with it have done a really wonderful job."" The school's headmaster, Julian Metcalf, said Sir Mick's return visit was ""very special and the icing on the cake"". ""He completely proved wrong that old adage that you should never meet your heroes. What a genuinely lovely guy,"" he told BBC Radio Kent. Mr Metcalf said Sir Mick watched a pupil concert - which ""he loved"" - and later performed on stage with students. ""It was unbelievable to watch,"" said the headteacher. ""You can take the boy out of Dartford, but you can never take the Dartford out of the boy. He has kept a real interest in Kent, Dartford and what is going on in the school."" Sir Mick first met The Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards on a platform at Dartford station, forming a friendship that would lead to the band's formation in 1962. The town has several streets named after The Rolling Stones songs, including Little Red Walk, Angie Mews and Ruby Tuesday Drive."
China US,Text scammers make tens of thousands a month - and spend it on designer shoes and bags ,2025-11-29T05:01:03.557Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4nzp6ezg7o,"""They don't keep money, they spend it here and now."" Det Ch Insp Paul Curtis is showing us around an evidence room piled high with designer shoes and handbags. Thousands of items are neatly stacked in plastic containers on wooden shelves. The items here have been seized from financial fraudsters, some of whom send scam texts - known as smishing - to victims. ""They like to live a lavish lifestyle,"" says Curtis. ""We have got somewhere between 8,500 and 10,000 items of evidence in this one room,"" he says, something that is ""the result of house searches and raids"" carried out by officers. The smell of fresh leather goods pervades the air. Brightly coloured Gucci stilettos catch the eye from a distance; it's a treasure trove of top-label kit worth tens of thousands of pounds. These purchases are an indication of how much cash they're making from their crimes and what they're spending it on. The term ""smishing"" is a combination of ""SMS"", or ""short message service"" - the technology behind text messages - and ""phishing"". Fraudsters send fake text messages - apparently from a bank or other trusted company - to trick people into disclosing personal information such as passwords and Pin numbers. The intention is to defraud them out of their money. Curtis is part of the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit - a team made up of officers from the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police service. Although they're London police forces, the unit has a national remit, and is sponsored by the banking industry. It focuses on combating financial fraud. ""In a recent smishing case of ours, the defendant was sentenced on the basis of sending 15,000 messages in a five day period. That equated to making a hundred thousand pounds a month,"" he says. The senior officer was talking about Ruichen Xiong, a student from China who was convicted of the crime after driving around London in March of this year, sending messages to tens of thousands of potential victims. Xiong was sentenced in June at Inner London Crown Court to 58 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to fraud by representation. According to Ofcom, half of UK mobile users said they received a suspicious message between November 2024 and February 2025 via text or iMessage. Gideon Rabinowitz, 64, lives in Newbury, Berkshire, and is a recent victim of smishing. Just two months ago, the former IT manager said he was cheated out of more than a thousand pounds after receiving a fraudulent text message. ""I felt like a massive fool, like I'd been violated,"" he says. ""It really shook me. For a number of days after it really left me quite shaken. I felt very vulnerable and I don't know who to trust now."" Mr Rabinowitz was led to believe he was being contacted by his bank who were reporting a suspicious payment on his account. In reality, he was being messaged by a scammer. ""It started with a text out of the blue asking if I recognised a transaction - yes or no. Two and half hours later I was out of pocket by £1400."" He adds: ""In part it was about the money and it was also this feeling of being defrauded, of being looked up, because these people knew who I was. They knew where I live"". Scam text messages often pretend to be from large companies such as utility companies, banks or supermarkets. They usually include a link. Once the person clicks on it, they can be sent to a fraudulent website and asked for personal and financial information. The information can then be used to convince them to transfer money from their account. Smishing is primarily done through two devices; a Sim farm which holds multiple Sim cards, allowing criminals to bombard people with thousands of scam texts. The second is what's called an SMS Blaster. It tricks mobiles nearby into connecting with it, and then sends large numbers of fraudulent texts in a matter of seconds. The government says ""smishing scams have a devastating impact on their victims"". ""Our Telecoms Charter sets out clear action to secure SMS and reduce fraud across the telecoms sector"". ""We are also banning Sim farms. Banning these devices used to send thousands of scam texts will close down a key tool for criminals and safeguard consumers,"" it says. The ban is expected to come into effect late next year. It will make the possession or supply of Sim farms, without a specified reason, illegal. One cyber expert said smishing was a difficult crime to solve and that there needs to be more education around fraudulent text messages. ""Smishing in and of itself is very hard to police because a lot of it comes from abroad and, even when it's done from within the UK it's very easy to do and hard to trace, "" says Ciaran Martin, the former Chief Executive of the National Cyber Security Centre. ""So while the police can sometimes take down big operations, we shouldn't look to the police as the strategic answer for this. ""The strategic answer is for people to understand that serious businesses don't ask you for money by text, and for businesses to find better ways of interacting with customers and verifying that interaction"". The advice from police is simple: do not click on the links in any unsolicited messages you receive. If you believe you're a victim of fraud, report to Action Fraud, report to your bank, and forward the message to 7726 so the mobile networks can investigate further."
China US,AI firm claims Chinese spies used its tech to automate cyber attacks,2025-11-14T12:16:51.557Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lzmygr84o,"The makers of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Claude claim to have caught hackers sponsored by the Chinese government using the tool to perform automated cyber attacks against around 30 global organisations. Anthropic said hackers tricked the chatbot into carrying out automated tasks under the guise of carrying out cyber security research. The company this was the ""first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign"". But sceptics are questioning the accuracy of that claim - and the motive behind it. Anthropic said it discovered the hacking attempts in mid-September. Pretending they were legitimate cyber security workers, hackers gave the chatbot small automated tasks which, when strung together, formed a ""highly sophisticated espionage campaign"". Researchers at Anthropic said they had ""high confidence"" the people carrying out the attacks were ""a Chinese state-sponsored group"". They said humans chose the targets - large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies – but the company would not be more specific. Hackers then built an unspecified programme using Claude's coding assistance to ""autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement"". Anthropic claims the chatbot was able to successfully breach various unnamed organisations, extract sensitive data and sort through it for valuable information. The company said it had since banned the hackers from using the chatbot and had notified affected companies and law enforcement. But Martin Zugec from cyber firm Bitdefender said the cyber security world had mixed feelings about the news. ""Anthropic's report makes bold, speculative claims but doesn't supply verifiable threat intelligence evidence,"" he said. ""Whilst the report does highlight a growing area of concern, it's important for us to be given as much information as possible about how these attacks happen so that we can assess and define the true danger of AI attacks."" Anthropic's announcement is perhaps the most high profile example of companies claiming bad actors are using AI tools to carry out automated hacks. It is the kind of danger many have been worried about, but other AI companies have also claimed that nation state hackers have used their products. In February 2024, OpenAI published a blog post in collaboration with cyber experts from Microsoft saying it had disrupted five state-affiliated actors, including some from China. ""These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,"" . Anthropic has not said how it concluded the hackers in this latest campaign were linked to the Chinese government. The Chinese embassy in the US told reporters it was not involved. It comes as some cyber security companies have been criticised for over-hyping cases where AI was used by hackers. Critics say the technology is still too unwieldy to be used for automated cyber attacks. In November, cyber experts at Google which highlighted growing concerns about AI being used by hackers to create brand new forms of malicious software. But the paper concluded the tools were not all that successful - and were only in a testing phase. The cyber security industry, like the AI business, is keen to say hackers are using the tech to target companies in order to boost the interest in their own products. In its blog post, Anthropic argued that the answer to stopping AI attackers is to use AI defenders. ""The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defence,"" the company claimed. And Anthropic admitted its chatbot made mistakes. For example, it made up fake login usernames and passwords and claimed to have extracted secret information which was in fact publicly available. ""This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,"" Anthropic said. to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. ."
China US,"Russian spy ship pointed lasers at RAF pilots tracking it, says UK",2025-11-19T19:07:00.819Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24028k7edo,"A Russian spy ship has used lasers for the first time to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters, the defence secretary has said. John Healey told reporters the ""deeply dangerous"" move from the Yantar was being taken ""extremely seriously"" by the government. He added that the vessel was north of Scotland and had entered UK waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks. The UK would continue monitoring the ship and had ""military options ready should the Yantar change course,"" he added. ""My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,"" he added. Healey said the laser incident took place whilst the Yantar was being followed by a Royal Navy frigate and RAF Poseidon P-8 planes deployed to ""track the vessel's every move"". It is understood the episode occurred within the last two weeks. Speaking at a news conference in Downing Street, the defence secretary added he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely ""when it is in our wider waters"". Healey said the vessel, which entered service in 2015, was part of Russia's Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), which was designed to ""undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict"". ""We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,"" he said. Asked about the risks posed by lasers, Healey replied: ""Anything that impedes, disrupts or puts at risk pilots in charge of British military planes is deeply dangerous."" The Russian Embassy released a statement, saying it was ""not interested in British underwater communications"". ""The actions of our country do not touch interests of the UK and they are not aimed at undermining its security,"" the statement said. It added: ""However, London, with its Russophobic path and increasing militaristic hysteria leads to further degradation European security, providing the premise for new dangerous situations. ""We call on the British side to hold off taking any destructive steps which might aggravate the crisis situation on the European continent."" Labour MP Matt Western, who chairs the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, said: ""Today's news demonstrates once again that Russia presents a genuine and immediate threat to the UK's security."" He added: ""I welcome the seriousness with which the defence secretary is treating this issue, but there is more we can do. More assertive retaliation may be required."" The defence secretary previously about the Yantar after it was spotted in UK waters in January, calling it ""another example of growing Russian aggression"". According to the ship tracking website Marine Traffic, the ship has not broadcast its location since 2 November, and was last tracked in the Baltic Sea north of the Latvian Coast. On 6 November, the Dutch Navy said two of its vessels escorted the Yantar out of the North Sea, where it was operating near Dutch territorial waters. While the Yantar's current position is not clear, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows an RAF Poseidon P-8 surveillance plane circling off the Scottish coast, although it is not certain that this is tracking the Yantar. Russia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables. Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American security think tank, said the Yantar's use of lasers was ""an escalation for sure"". ""Essentially, you do it to impede the pilots from doing their work,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""We don't know exactly how strong the lasers were, but even if they didn't blind the pilots, it was provocative,"" she added. The UK and its Nato allies are to offshore cables, pipelines and other infrastructure critical to internet connectivity. In his speech, the defence secretary warned about Russian incursions into Nato airspace, as well as the threats posed by China and armed conflicts around the world, adding: ""Our world is changing. It is less predictable. It is more dangerous."" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has come under for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack. The committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal. Healey said the UK government ""takes a different view"" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato. But he said the committee was ""right to say"" Britain should ""pick up the pace of our commitment"" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year. The report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme . The Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month. Healey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not ""at any price"", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part. It has been reported that the EU is demanding an entry fee running to billions of euros before the UK can take part. He added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be ""good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry""."
China US,"'I worked, I paid taxes - then the bank took my home'",2025-11-19T03:39:23.284Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jz321x14o,"""I am waiting for the bailiff to knock on the door, take my keys and kick me out,"" says Jose Da Costa Diogo, one of thousands of people who have been told this year their homes will be repossessed. The 65-year-old learned he would lose his home in Thetford, Norfolk, during a brisk 10-minute county court hearing earlier this year. The interest-only mortgage on the three-bedroom property was taken out more than 20 years ago in the hope he and his then wife would save up enough to eventually cover the capital sum. But the collapse of the marriage and his ex-wife's departure to Brazil in 2015, left Mr Da Costa Diogo unable to repay the £80,000 still outstanding. And because his ex-wife was still on both the mortgage documents and the property deeds, he was also unable to sell the property to cover the outstanding amount. ""I tried to do the right thing and carried on paying all the bills,"" he said. ""After 25 years, I have nothing to show... but I still have to carry on living. ""I'm going to be homeless."" Court figures - the highest number in five years. Experts say the rise is down to a variety of factors and the rise in the general cost of living. Mr Da Costa Diogo registered as homeless with Breckland Council, his local authority. He is far from alone. The BBC asked every English council with housing responsibilities how many people presented as homeless as a result of a mortgage repossession. The number has doubled, according to the 240 councils that provided comparable data - from 1,517 in 2022-23, to 2,370 in 2023-24. It was 3,406 in the most recent year. People in local government say rehoming those affected by repossessions is putting ever greater stress on council resources. Tom Hunt, who chairs the Local Government Association's Inclusive Growth Board, said: ""As more and more people turn to their council for help, local authorities are having to stretch budgets further. ""The temporary accommodation crisis facing councils is only worsening."" Lucy Davies sees the devastation repossessions can have on a daily basis. A housing law advisor with the Suffolk Law Centre, she volunteers her expertise to those in need at courts in Suffolk and Essex. ""I see the sheer number of people that this is affecting,"" said Ms Davies. ""People get into difficulties largely through no fault of their own. ""Quite often there's mental health, there's employment issues, there's family issues, and I think it can very quickly spiral out of control."" On the day the BBC joined Ms Davies for a day at Ipswich County Court, where she volunteers with the Ipswich County Court Advice and Representation Service, none of the five people facing mortgage repossession cases turned up. This, she said, was often a symptom of shame, despair and the sense that losing one's home is a foregone conclusion. ""It is quite frightening coming to court, but it doesn't have to be."" She urged people to seek advice as soon as possible and said the cases she was seeing were becoming ""more entrenched or more serious"". People were finding it increasingly difficult to access housing legal aid, she explained. Paul Gorton, of The Law Society's housing law committee, agreed. He said a historic lack of investment in legal aid meant fewer and fewer law firms were able to offer legal aid housing advice. ""Many people are too well off to be eligible for legal aid but cannot afford to pay for legal advice themselves,"" Mr Gorton said. ""We have both legal aid provider deserts and restrictive eligibility criteria leaving many people stuck in limbo."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it had recently announced ""the first major funding increase for housing legal aid in three decades - a 24% rise"". ""This investment will help ensure effective access to justice for some of the most vulnerable in our society, while supporting a more stable and sustainable legal aid sector,"" the spokesperson said. Seeking to repossess a home is ""always a last resort"" for lenders, said Karina Hutchins, a principal in the mortgage policy team at UK Finance, a trade association for the banking and financial services sector. She said while the number of mortgage repossessions had been creeping up in recent years, the current levels remained ""historically low"". ""Repossessions are really, really uncommon."" She said in the first quarter of 2025, about 2,000 homes were repossessed compared with 13,000 in the same quarter of 2009, in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. ""I can imagine that customers are really worried and distressed if they're facing financial difficulty, but they don't have to go through it alone,"" Ms Hutchins said. ""The earlier they get in touch with their mortgage lender, the more support and help that that lender can give them and the more likelihood they have of getting back up to date with their mortgage."" Options offered by lenders, she said, included reduced mortgage payments to allow time to get back on track, budgeting and other tools to understand ""their full financial situation"" and advice about debt charities and support organisations. Henry Sabati McRae, who lives in Croydon, south London, has so far managed to stave off repossession. A software developer by training, Mr McRae's financial woes came in the wake of the death of a brother in 2020 and his mother in October 2023. Since October 2024, the 51-year-old has been out of work and, despite applying for hundreds of jobs, he has not managed to get a new contract. ""It doesn't matter how much you have in savings,"" he said. ""Within a few months it is wiped out. I managed to stretch it as far as I could, because I'd been quite conservative with how I was doing."" Even so, the mortgage arrears on his two-bedroom flat eventually grew to about £13,000 and his bank said if that figure was not reduced to below £8,000 it would seek to repossess his home. ""The most important thing for me at that time, and I think for anybody, was keeping the roof over my head,"" he said. ""Otherwise it spirals out of control."" To scrape by, he has turned to selling off his possessions on an internet auction site and accepting a loan from a friend. Like many of those facing repossession action the BBC has spoken to, Mr McRae said the experience was deeply ""humiliating"" and that his instincts were initially ""to draw the curtains shut"". However, he said realising he was far from alone and in speaking about it has helped him plot out, like an IT problem, his ""solution to it"". Businessman Mike Williams, who lives 10 miles (16km) south of Mr McRae in Caterham, Surrey, has also avoided repossession. He took on the mortgage of his self-build home after he and his wife separated. In three years, repayments on the interest-only loan, which was taken out 20 years ago, have tripled. He says it has left him with ""next to no disposable income"". At court, he renegotiated a repayment plan which would add an extra 20% to his monthly payments. In five years, when the mortgage comes to term, he intends to sell the two-bedroom house which he and his wife built from the ground up. ""It has quite a bit of sentimental value to me, so yes it is heart-wrenching,"" he said. As for Mr Da Costa Diogo, his bank has repossessed the property. In the same month it was repossessed, the BBC saw a similar three-bedroom property in the same Thetford street as Mr Da Costa Diogo's on the market for £160,000 - almost double the amount he owed. Within hours of losing his home, he was given emergency accommodation in a small ground-floor studio in north Suffolk. ""I left my house with one suitcase and a bag of essentials and told the council 'I'm homeless'. ""It's a roof over my head. I'm trying to keep things simple because what is the point of complicating things? ""I'm alive and I carry on."" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day."
China US,On the front line of Europe's standoff with Russia's sanction-busting shadow fleet,2025-11-19T00:23:14.958Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91dk0l50no,"Out on the western Baltic, a coastguard officer radios a nearby, sanctioned oil tanker. ""Swedish Coastguard calling… Do you consent to answer a few questions for us? Over."" Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt. ""I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,"" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin. This is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet""; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports. After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance. Some ""shadow"" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or ""spoofing"" their location data. Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of ""shadow"" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically ""floating rust buckets"", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, ""good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost"". Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: ""There's no secret made about it."" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as ""false"". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called , but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection. Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point ""where they just don't even bother at all"", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages. Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air that ""shadow"" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. While politicians , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea. The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it. Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event. ""There's a complexity associated with it,"" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. ""With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis."" The Estonians speak from experience. When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has ""constantly"" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk. The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken. ""Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,"" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, ""we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself"". ""Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies."" Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up. ""Thank you for your co-operation,"" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia. The exchange lasted just over five minutes. ""You need to see it in a larger perspective,"" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: ""This information can be used in our maritime surveillance."" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: ""You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels."" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile ""the dark fleet is getting darker"". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's ""anti-Russian sanctions"" were ""illegitimate"" and ""undermine established principles of global commerce"". ""Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,"" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to ""easily resolved"" issues such as administrative delays. It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had ""heightened"" the risks by ""forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape""."
China US,How a 'fertility gap' is fuelling the rise of one-child families,2025-12-05T14:39:45.809Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyv7211jljo,"""It was nice to hear someone giving it a name,"" she says. She and her husband have a five-year-old daughter called Joanie but they knew they probably wouldn't have a second child - not because they couldn't, but not out of choice, either: Natalie finds it hard to imagine having the time and money for one. ""You know you'd love that baby, everyone tells you, but there's a little teeny niggle where you think, 'what if I put my first in that position where she can't do the activity she wants to do because I've got to spread money out between two'?"" She adds: ""Is it okay to say you're only having one because they don't fit into modern ways of parenting?"" Modern parenting, for Natalie, 35, looks like family holidays with Joanie. It looks like weekday evenings hearing about her day at school and helping her with homework. But, with demanding jobs and no family living nearby to help with childcare, it also looks like an expensive childcare jigsaw. But ultimately, deciding whether or not to have a second is a tough decision. ""I think you worry you'd regret it,"" she says. The fertility rate was 1.41 children per woman in England and Wales last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest on record for a third year running. Separately, the proportion of families with one dependent child has grown since the turn of the century - that includes families with one child, as well as those who also have children over 18 or may have left home. They made up 44% of all families in England and Wales with dependent children living with them, up from 42% in 2000. (Though the peak was 47% in the early 2010s, which then dipped before picking up again after Covid.) The UK's falling birth rate is part of what the United Nations calls a ""global fertility slump"", which it puts down, in part, to money worries. People aren't ""turning their backs on parenthood"", says the UN in a summary of its Population Fund's State of World Population report, which surveyed people across 14 countries. Instead it says they ""are being denied the freedom to start families due to skyrocketing living costs, persistent gender inequality and deepening uncertainty about the future"". Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said earlier this year that she wants ""more young people to have children, if they so choose"". She pointed to the expansion of funded childcare hours in England as a way the government was trying to recover ""dashed dreams"". Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England did fall this year for the first time in 15 years, . They are now an average of £12,425, down 22% on the previous year. However they are slightly up in Scotland and Wales, at £12,468 and £15,038 respectively. A study from University College London (UCL) last year suggested two-fifths of 32-year-olds in England want children – or more children, if they are already parents – but only one in four of them are actively trying to conceive. Dr Paula Sheppard, an anthropologist at the University of Oxford, believes parents in the West still think of having two children as ""the norm"". However, she says there is a ""fertility gap"" and that ""for every three kids wanted… only two are born"". ""A lot of this gap is driven by… people starting families later and later in life,"" she explains – often a result of education and career opportunities for women and changing gender roles. ""It becomes a whole lot more difficult to get pregnant [and] it becomes a whole lot more difficult to keep the pregnancy."" The falling birthrate is giving education policymakers a headache. The number of pupils in England has dropped by 150,000 since 2019, and will fall by a further 400,000 by the end of the decade, according to the Education Policy Institute. Schools are given money per pupil, so fewer pupils means less cash. Less cash, in turn, is an issue for those head teachers struggling to fund staffing and resources. About a year ago, a post on a UK Reddit thread for teachers raised what one contributor saw as another potential impact of more only children on the education system. The contributor wrote that they had seen a rise in ""spoilt"" children with ""demanding behaviour due to overindulgent parenting"". These children tended to have siblings who were much older or no siblings at all, they claimed. The idea that children without siblings may be selfish or spoiled dates back to research conducted in the late 19th century by psychologists G Stanley Hall and E W Bohannon. ""Selfishness is one of the most striking traits of the only children in families,"" they wrote in their Study of Peculiar and Exceptional Children. ""'The only child' is deficient on the social side."" But more recent studies have debunked that idea. ""Numerous studies have disproven these myths that only children are maladjusted, spoiled, and lonely,"" explains Dr Adriean Mancillas, a psychologist and professor in California State University's education department. Dr Mancillas has spent her career exploring family dynamics, the development of only children, and mental health intervention in schools - and says most research ""consistently demonstrates advantages of being an only child, particularly in educational and academic outcomes"". This is down, mainly, to a theory called ""resource dilution"". In simple terms, she says this means parents with one child ""are able to be more involved in their child's education"". ""Children with siblings share in parents' time, emotional support, attention, and financial resources whereas the only child does not,"" says Dr Mancillas. ""This singular focus of resources tends to provide academic advantages for the only child."" She points to some research that suggests many only children did better academically when schools closed to most pupils in lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, ""because of the relative availability of parental resources"". ""Resource dilution"" is one of three social science theories about the consequences of being an only child, according to University College London (UCL) academics. The second is ""confluence theory"", which also suggests that only children perform better than children with siblings academically because a family's ""intellectual environment"" declines as the number of children grows. Then there is ""socialisation theory"" which, in contrast, argues that siblings help children learn how to share, negotiate and resolve conflict. Existing research, according to the UCL academics, support the first two theories. But, like Dr Mancillas, they say it ""generally does not support the socialisation theory as it finds that only children are comparable to children with siblings (especially those with few siblings) in terms of personality, parent-child relationships, achievement, motivation and personal adjustment"". Dr Mancillas suggests there could be something else feeding into only children's better academic performance, too. ""Studies show that parents with one child tend to have attained higher educational outcomes themselves than parents of multiple children,"" she says. ""Much of the time, parents have delayed having children in order to complete career or higher educational goals. This would suggest that parents who have one child likely place a high value on education overall."" Earlier this year, Susan Newman, an American psychologist explored so-called only-child dynasties - where parents who are only-children, have one child themselves - in an article to accompany her new book, Just One: The New Science, Secrets & Joy of Parenting an Only Child. One of the most surprising findings from the new research for her book was, she wrote: ""Adult only-children are increasingly choosing to have ""just one"" child themselves. ""The resulting only-child dynasties underscore the trend. Count on seeing more of them, most noticeably without the spoiled, entitled 'little emperors' we heard so much about for so long -despite a lack of evidence to support such misinformed stereotypes."" The phrase has been used as shorthand to describe the only children born under China's one-child policy, the idea held by some being that it led to a generation of ""solitary children pampered and paraded with a retinue of parents and elders"". However, while the policy did leave a lasting legacy after its end in 2015 - an ageing population, for example, and a gender imbalance because of a traditional preference for male children - research has suggested that the ""little emperor effect"" has not been a part of it. There were ""very few only-child effects"" on children's personality, according to a study of Chinese schoolchildren carried out by American researchers at two Texas Universities. The phrase ""one and done"" was only just beginning to emerge when New York-based journalist Lauren Sandler began writing her 2013 book, One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One. ""I would be on the subway with my adorable child and someone would say, 'so cute, when are you having another one?' ""There is so little discussion about what it means to have single children, which is incredible to me considering how many there are."" She adds: ""I think that people feel very alone in this."" She began to question why some people assumed she would want more children, something she also explored for her work. It used to be that having larger families was how we survived, she points out. ""A family was a workforce, and that was very much a necessity until the industrial revolution."" Only after the industrial revolution, and the introduction of child labour and welfare laws did that change. ""The opportunity costs and the economic costs of children shifted dramatically,"" she explains. She also questioned the negative connotations that can sometimes be associated with having one child. ""There's also a lot of research that shows that only children do not take relationships for granted at a very, very young age. So, [it's not the same as when you] fight with your older brother and then just, through exposure, need to make up again. ""These people aren't going to be at the dinner table with you every night. Because of that, there's a lot of care that seems to come into relationships. And so that is sort of the opposite of the selfish stereotype of only children."" So teachers may not really have a generation of ""little emperors"" on their hands. But the is still very much being felt by some schools, and more widely too. Policymakers, for example, are grappling with the impact of the UK's ageing population on public services, taxes, and the growing cost of state pensions. ""Falling birth rates and an ageing population can create pressures on public services and public finances because the balance between the number of people working and the number of people drawing on age-related services changes over time,"" says Dr Alina Pelikh of University College London, who specialises in demography. ""Governments may need to consider adjustments - whether through pension age, contributions, or other measures - to ensure long-term sustainability."" The concerns are global, and governments around the world are trying to encourage people to have more children. US President Donald Trump has mentioned the idea of a $5,000 ""baby bonus"". Poland has just introduced a policy of zero personal income tax for families with two or more children. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has introduced tax exemptions for mothers. But for all the the statistics and policymaking this is, ultimately, a very personal decision. Natalie couldn't be prouder of her daughter, who has recently been made ""values ambassador"" in her class, encouraging other children to show empathy and respect. ""She has been chosen, not because she's an only child, because they don't know whether she's got siblings or not. She's been chosen based on her personality,"" says Natalie. ""I don't think I was ever worried about not giving her [a sibling], because you can never have a child for somebody else. ""You've got to have a child for yourself, haven't you?"""
China US,US calls for international action to cut weapons supply to Sudan paramilitaries,2025-11-14T08:20:20.531Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1nwy7q8o,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are accused of mass killings in el-Fasher. At the end of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada, Rubio said the RSF had committed systematic atrocities, including murder, rape and sexual violence against civilians. Sudan's army accuses the United Arab Emirates of propping up the RSF with weapons and mercenaries sent via African nations. The UAE and the RSF have repeatedly denied these allegations. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into all-out civil war. Rubio's comments are some of the most outspoken so far by the Trump administration about the war in Sudan and the actions of the RSF, but it is not clear how much impact they will have. A previous US-backed proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan has already been violated by the RSF, even though they agreed to it last week. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF after an 18-month siege, meaning they now control all of the cities in the vast western Darfur region. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee the city, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Non-Arab groups in the wider Darfur region are being systematically targeted by the RSF in what amounts to genocide, according to the US and humanitarian groups. At the talks near Niagara Falls on Wednesday, America's top diplomat said women and children had been targeted in acts of the most horrific kind by the RSF in el-Fasher. Rubio told reporters: ""They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind.  And it needs to end immediately. ""And we're going to do everything we can to bring it to an end, and we've encouraged partner nations to join us in this fight."" However, Rubio stopped short of publicly criticising Abu Dhabi, in spite of evidence that the Gulf state is the RSF's main arms supplier, presented in investigations by the international media that the UN has found credible. The Trump administration is working for an end to the war together with the UAE, as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who are allies of Sudan's military-led government, collectively known as the ""Quad"". ""I don't want to get into calling anybody out at a press conference today, because what we want is a good outcome here,"" Rubio said on Wednesday, but added pointedly: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" In September, the Quad jointly proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. In a statement on Thursday, the UAE expressed ""alarm at the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in El Fasher"". It went on to accuse the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusations the army has previously denied. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. The secretary of state rejected the paramilitary group's attempt to blame the killings on rogue elements, saying this was false and the attacks were systematic. Asked by the BBC about his assessment of the likely scale of atrocities, he said the US feared that thousands of people who had been expected to flee el-Fasher were either dead or too malnourished to move. He said the RSF, lacking its own arms manufacturing facilities, relied on outside support, and called for countries supplying weapons to stop. In response the RSF issued a lengthy statement denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"". The paramilitary group repeated denials that it does not receive support from external parties and said it did not accept attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. ""The party that has rejected all ceasefire initiatives and refused to engage in them is the army affiliated with the terrorist Islamic Movement,"" it said, ""while our forces responded in good faith officially announcing their approval. Yet to this day we have not received any reply from the US side. So, where is the other party and where is its response?"" The joint G7 statement also condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". To date, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes. The flow of weapons into the country during this two-year-long civil war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups."
China US,"Mass killings probe in Sudan will hold culprits to account, vows UN",2025-11-14T17:24:51.089Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jd4elgwzo,"The UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher. ""Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,"" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher. The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies  ""fuelling and profiting"" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Speaking on Friday, Türk said: ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population."" The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - .

China US,The private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UK's Covid response,2025-11-20T00:12:50.970Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78zy20ydlmo,"It was the most momentous event in UK history since World War Two. As a new virus took hold, millions of us were told to stay at home and billions of pounds were spent propping up the country's economy. The Covid inquiry will publish its second set of findings on Thursday, looking in detail at the huge political choices made at the time - including how lockdowns were introduced, the closure of businesses and schools, and bringing in previously unthinkable social restrictions. ""Did the government serve the people well, or did it fail them?"" asked the lead counsel at the start of this part of the inquiry in 2023. Since then more than 7,000 documents have been made public from the time, including WhatsApp chats and emails, private diaries and confidential files. Here, BBC News has picked out some of the urgent messages and scribbled notes that shine a light on how critical decisions were taken in 2020. On 2 January 2020 , a service used by health workers to warn of emerging diseases. ""World Health Organization in touch with Beijing after mystery viral pneumonia outbreak,"" it says. ""Twenty-seven people - most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - treated in hospital."" The next day England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, sends the bulletin on to Peter Horby, a professor at Oxford University and chair of Nervtag, a group that advises the government on new viral threats. By the end of January, it's clear the health authorities in Wuhan have a major problem on their hands. The deputy ambassador to China, Christina Scott, comparing the situation to the outbreak of another virus - SARS - in 2003. ""Hubei province on lockdown; multiple cities have transport restrictions. Memory of SARS cover-up ensures residual distrust of government response,"" it says. ""They will do everything they can to quickly control this outbreak. But the challenge of doing so is substantial."" The virus spreads to Thailand and South Korea and then to Iran and northern Italy. At lunchtime on Saturday 7 March the UK's then prime minister, Boris Johnson, is ahead of the England vs Wales game at Twickenham. Days later, the Cheltenham horse racing festival goes ahead and Atletico Madrid fans are allowed to fly from Spain to Liverpool to watch their team play in the Champions League. The government's strategy, backed by its scientific advisers, is to try to contain early outbreaks by isolating those with the virus and tracing any contacts. The plan is then to move to a ""delay phase"" as full community transmission is established – using policies like home isolation advice for those with symptoms to ""flatten the curve"" of the pandemic so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed. But the virus is spreading much faster than expected and it‘s quickly becoming clear to some scientists that far stronger action will be needed. On Friday 13 March, two senior No 10 officials are sitting in a key meeting of scientific advisers in Whitehall. ""WE ARE NOT READY,"" . The other leans over and crosses out ""NOT READY"", replacing it with an expletive. That weekend, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is locked in a series of meetings with the PM and a handful of select staff as a new strategy takes shape. Grainy smartphone images show whiteboards in No 10 and . One graph suggests that, if the virus was allowed to run its course without any restrictions in place, then more than 100,000 people would die ""in [hospital] corridors"" in the coming wave. On Sunday 15 March, Cummings : ""FYI – [Patrick] Vallance [the chief scientific adviser] is on board with what will NEVER be discussed as Plan B."" ""[In a] nutshell: we move through the gears to [do] whatever we need to stop NHS collapse and buy time to increase capacity."" Over the following week, Covid rules across the UK are tightened. People are advised, but not legally required, to avoid all non-essential contact and work from home where possible. Then schools are closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas. But still there are concerns that even those measures are not strong enough. On Sunday 22 March, London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, . The next evening, in a televised address watched by 27 million people, the prime minister tells the public they must stay at home as he announces the first national lockdown. It will now be up to the inquiry to decide if making that call earlier could have saved lives and ultimately reduced the total time that people had to stay locked indoors. Over the next month some hospitals do come under severe pressure with intensive care units spilling into corridors and side rooms. Pre-planned or elective care is put on hold but at no point does the NHS have to turn away emergency patients. Covid infections, hospitalisations and deaths start to fall. But the cost of lockdown restrictions is huge: education is disrupted, loneliness and mental health problems get worse, and jobs and businesses are impacted. On 22 May, Johnson asking for a plan to ""start operation BOUNCEBACK"". That month some restrictions begin to be lifted – soon groups of six are able to meet outdoors and schools start a phased re-opening. In the summer, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak tries to boost the economy with his Eat Out to Help Out scheme - 50% off food and drinks for three days a week in August. The idea is well received by the hospitality industry but there are concerns about the health impact. On WhatsApp (with spelling mistakes), Hancock warns Simon Case, then the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, that it's - that’s those local authorities with the highest infection rates. In his evidence to the inquiry, saying a second wave ""happened in every other country in Europe"". But that tension – between controlling Covid and protecting the economy – becomes even more intense through the autumn. Many scientists advising the government want to see tighter rules. They campaign for a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown to try to drive down infections. At times the documents suggest the prime minister supports tougher restrictions, at others he appears determined to avoid another strict national lockdown at all costs. On WhatsApp – using an emoji of a broken trolley as he appears to swerve from one policy position to another. ""This government doesn't have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not to,"" writes Case, who is now the new cabinet secretary, to Cummings and Lee Cain, No 10 director of communications, on 14 October. ""We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this."" In his testimony to the inquiry, Case later says he regrets expressing his ""at-the-moment frustrations"" with Johnson, whom he ""barely knew"" at the time. In his evidence, Johnson defends his own leadership style, saying his views changed with the scientific evidence, and he often adopted certain positions because he wanted to hear the counter arguments. As the nights draw in that autumn, it becomes clear that existing restrictions in England - including a 10pm curfew and the so-called tiered system of local controls - are not going to be enough to control the virus. By the end of October, the prime minister's frustration is obvious in the long note he marked OFFICIAL/SENSITIVE. In tightly spaced handwriting, Johnson pens 22 detailed points over two A4 pages of the document. He approves of strengthening some local restrictions but bemoans the ""terrible cost"" and wonders ""for HOW LONG?"" ""Is NHS T&T [test and trace] actually achieving ANYTHING?"" he asks at one point. A week later, on 5 November 2020, England does enter its second national lockdown, this time lasting four weeks, although most schools remain open. By this point many decisions are being taken independently by the four nations of the UK. Both Wales and Northern Ireland put in place versions of a circuit breaker lockdown, while in Scotland stricter rules are imposed in the central belt. The plan is still to allow families and friends to meet up at Christmas. But by mid-December a new, more infectious variant of the virus is spreading and millions living in the south-east of England are told at short notice that Christmas mixing will be cancelled. In January 2021, a third and final full national lockdown follows across the UK, as the winter wave peaks and the NHS starts rolling out millions of doses of the first Covid vaccines. Five years on from those dramatic 12 months, the inquiry's findings are long-awaited, particularly by the 235,000 families who lost loved ones in the pandemic. The messages and documents highlighted here are just a snapshot - the report due later will run to around 800 pages. It will examine some of the key questions in much more detail: the timing of lockdowns, the impact of restrictions on the most vulnerable, and public confidence in the rules amid reports of partying in Downing Street and other alleged rule breaches. Groups representing thousands of bereaved families want individuals working in government at the time to be held to account for any pandemic failings. But - above all - they want the state to learn lessons from any mistakes and be better prepared if and when the next unknown virus arrives on our shores.

China US,Swap shops reducing waste grow in popularity ,2025-11-08T07:25:02.177Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6zg2qe40o,"A community group dedicated to reducing waste said the popularity of its ""swap shop"" events is increasing. Sustainable Devizes first held a Devizes Swap Shop in 2022 from a small stand in the town's market place, with a couple of tables of books and toys. The event, which is now held at least three times a year and is attended by hundreds of people, is taking place later at St James' Church. People are encouraged to donate unwanted toys, games, crafts, books, houseplants and school uniforms, and can take anything away for free in exchange. Helen Langford now volunteers at the swap shops after first using the service herself. ""One time, I found it quite moving because I remember a particular lady who had a few children with her and she was basically saying, 'I couldn't have got through Christmas without this', and I knew it was making a really big difference,"" she said. ""For me personally, I was driven by trying to be more eco-friendly and trying to spend less, waste less and see stuff used for its whole life, rather than just used for a  season and out the door."" The founder, Sam Drury Shore, said: ""The reason I love the swaps is the co-benefits they bring. ""Our initial motivation was very much about reducing waste, and trying to gently change people's mindsets around consumption. ""But with the cost of living crisis, we can really see that the swaps are a huge help to families - hopefully without it seeming patronising or stigmatising as our framing is 'you are helping by reducing waste', rather than 'you are being helped by being given free stuff'."" The Devizes Swap Shop is taking place at St James' Church from 10:00 GMT."
China US,Mysterious drones have been spotted at night at airports across Europe. How worried should we be?,2025-11-17T00:17:43.171Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkl3d6pegpo,"It's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens. This is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine. These are attack drones that explode on impact. Drones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield. Across western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of ""hybrid warfare"" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine. Recent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries. Now, there is talk that a ""drone wall"" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic? On 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports. Nato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions. This was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began. Which is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing. ""This momentum is really driven by these recent incursions,"" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank. Drones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space. On the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices. But these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall. Previously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September. So, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond? After all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: ""[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money."" Ukraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians. Then there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet. But there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war. That is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared. Sometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports. This includes a suspected drone incursion above Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. Unlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these ""civilian drones"" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships. Suspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility. Belgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions). There is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base? The UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones. Still, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants. The plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia. The wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea. It's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027. Not surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia. Katja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue. But she adds:  ""This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders."" Nonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic. Robert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some ""sort of impervious wall"", is, in his words, out of the question. Yet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try. ""For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,"" he says. ""The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable"", agrees Ms Bego. ""It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them."" Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones. ""You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets. ""You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill."" Hard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means. Russia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders. As for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters. ""You can have lasers which could be useful as well,"" he adds, ""but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be."" André Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once. As tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called ""hybrid"" or ""grey zone"" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them. These include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables. And yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority. The first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised. Meanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge. Mr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. ""You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres. ""And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap."" The question of finance is a complex one. ""It is a really difficult defence question,"" says Mr Tollast. ""Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well. ""So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people."" It will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets. Initially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it. ""Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion... ""The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets"". As for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, ""they can definitely achieve more protection by then"". While all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them. This all makes it something of a new arms race. ""The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,"" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology. ""It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust. ""The aggressor"", he concludes, ""will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through"". So are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow. ""It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,"" argues Ms Bego. ""And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this."" But any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory. Ever since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war. Building a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another."
China US,Elon Musk's $1tn pay deal approved by Tesla shareholders,2025-11-07T10:03:09.647Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyk6kvyxvzo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders. The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares. The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him. Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name. ""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" he said. ""Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,"" he added. The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include: He won't receive a salary under the agreed deal. But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough. Musk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an ""autonomous humanoid robot"" performing ""unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks."" Using the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future. He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would - and in future, in homes. ""Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,"" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X. ""His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet."" Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was ""almost comfortable"" allowing drivers to ""text and drive essentially."" US regulators are after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries. Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months. Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring. Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks ""another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business."" Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. It is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added. Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over ""the polarisation of [Musk's] persona"" which has ""demolished the value of the brand"". ""Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,"" he said. Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him ""Tesla's biggest asset"" in a note published after the vote. ""We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,"" Mr Ives added. Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he ""hit those milestones ahead of schedule"" in 2018. She said his political interests had created some ""polarisation"", but his pay package did not ""put any constraints on his activities"" outside of the company. Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did. But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk. Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision. The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting. In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts. A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk. Kathryn Hannon, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the new pay deal would give Musk ""increasing voting power over the company"", which he had long been requesting for a number of years. ""Elon Musk, whether you like him or not, he is a visionary in this space and I guess putting the correct governance and incentivisation structures around him to deliver this does align him, hopefully, with shareholders on that success journey."""
China US,Tutoring a baby to make him an 'English gentleman' - Is it worth the money?,2025-11-10T08:38:50.561Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kljww1zdo,"When reading this advert, you would be forgiven for skimming over the words ""first steps"", as a turn of phrase. But, it could be the most significant part of this unique job advert, as it seeks to find a tutor for a one-year-old. Hundreds of applications have now been submitted since the anonymous family published their request for the £180k-a-year tutor, who has to be ""someone very special"". Over the last few weeks, the advert has gained attention across the media, with many questioning why? Adam Caller, CEO and founder of Tutors International, which is assisting the family in their search, said despite initial scepticism, he found the idea ""far sighted"", and ""progressive"". When he met the family, he said they appreciated the unusual nature of their request, and how young their son is. However, they explained that they ""didn't want to wait any longer"" to get a tutor, as they had waited until their older child was five, and by that stage ""cultural bias had already set in"". But what does the family mean by ""cultural bias""? It's ""everything"", Adam replied. ""The way you eat, the way you speak."" He said the older sibling had picked ""really subtle, non-verbal cues"" from the family, and had adopted their cultural ways. The family told Adam they did not want history to repeat itself with their new baby. The plan: , who must speak with received pronunciation, to influence the baby right from the beginning. ""A lot of the learning at the beginning here is kind of osmotic,"" said Adam. It's via this osmosis that the family are hoping the child will pick up the British traits they wish to instil. Adam said the tutor had to be somebody who went to ""the right kinds of schools - the same kinds of schools as the family aspire to send their son to"". ""The tutor just has to be the right kind of person, they'll be doing things they don't even know they're doing, just naturally,"" he said. The family told Adam the successful candidate should ideally also have knowledge of or interest in horse-riding, skiing, the arts and music so as to influence the child in a broad spectrum of interests. More than that though, he said the family wanted the tutor to enrol the child on a range of classes so the child would be ""pony-riding and picking up an instrument by the time they are around three years old"". In the family's minds, helping their son become a ""British gentleman"" will lead to success and open doors. ""For all the rights and wrongs of that, because it's definitely a class statement,"" he adds. But, despite all this tutelage in ""Britishness"", could the child pick up so-called cultural bias from the international family he lives with anyway? ""Yes"", said Adam. ""The family know this may not work, but they've just taken the view of, 'let's give it a go and let's go as early as we can', because the cost of it is not relevant,"" he said. There are some in the tutoring industry who share those concerns. Peter Cui, CEO and founder of Blue Education, which also offers private tutors, wrote that ""the process of becoming bicultural, or indeed, becoming oneself, is something that must be lived into, not engineered"". Peter wrote that he had moved from China to the UK at the age of seven, and had been raised knowing and living both cultures. He went on to study at Cambridge University. ""The idea that one individual can serve as a living vessel of Britishness, someone who can somehow transplant the qualities of a British gentleman on to a one-year-old child, strikes me as idealistic and unrealistic,"" he wrote. ""In my experience, having a quintessentially British tutor from infancy will not automatically produce the outcome they desire. ""I never had such a figure, and yet I have been fortunate enough to live many of the experiences they aspire for their son."" He added: ""The truth is, cultural identity cannot be imposed from the outside; it must be chosen, and it must come from within."" Of course, Britishness is something Adam hopes can be taught - and sold. ""I think the fact that the world holds us in this regard is something that we should be cherishing and taking advantage of at the same time,"" he said. ""I don't think that, as British people, we should be embarrassed by this,"" Adam said. ""I think we should be proud of it."" The market for buying Britishness isn't just helping Adam's tutoring business, it's given rise to businesses such as Laura Windsor's Etiquette Academy. Laura, like other ""etiquette experts"", can teach people - for a fee - how to take afternoon tea, dress and hold a conversation, ""like a British person"". ""Society has become so diluted and unrestrained, people now want to go back to the way it was,"" she said. The demand for etiquette training is mainly from international clients who wish to be able to interact at business meetings and functions, she said. But she also teaches groups of children too. Why? ""Because being a polite gentleman or gentlewoman is all about first impressions,"" she said. ""Being polite means you respect other people, you make them feel comfortable and important. When you make people feel important, you're liked, and that opens doors to incredible opportunities."" She says she teaches people how it's ""all in the details"": ""It's about opening doors, and saying 'please' and 'thank you', and thinking about the other person."" Laura's students are never usually as young as one, but starting that young is something the etiquette expert says can have benefits. ""Starting at one, they will grow up being a gentleman, and therefore it's not a question of 'tweaking', it's who they are. ""Whereas nowadays, people need to be tweaked a little bit, to be a little bit more aware of what they do,"" she said. Raising his children to be classically British - with all the etiquette trimmings - is not the priority for Daniel (not his real name). ""Far from leaning into English, British values, we wanted the total opposite. We are trying to go away from the UK system and the straitjacket of that,"" he said. Daniel is currently employing one of Adam's super-tutors to work with his three children around their school hours. Next year the tutor will accompany the whole family as they move abroad for work. For Daniel and his wife, it's about teaching emotional intelligence, and preparing their children for a world influenced by artificial intelligence. Neither believes this is possible without an external tutor. The current British school system ""isn't fit for purpose"", he said, adding that one private school in London, has now dropped most of the GCSE examination system and instead uses its own in-house system which involves more group work activities and project-based learning. ""If GCSEs aren't going to be recognised everywhere - and are not the gold standard - maybe we would be better leaning into a tutor where we get so much more out of it,"" Daniel said. ""Right here, right now, in the UK school system, if I look at the quality of teacher my kids would get at a private school versus these tutors, it's an absolute joke - there is a real discrepancy,"" he said. He added that he recognised hiring a high-end tutor was for ""those in a lucky financial situation"", but explained that since private school fees , he felt the cost of the private tutor had become comparable for three children. ""My kids could have one-20th of a very average person's attention in school, or they could have one-third of an absolutely exceptional person - it's an absolute no-brainer."""
China US,Where is The Celebrity Traitors castle and can I ride the train?,2025-11-07T08:54:27.414Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4njdj4kxw2o,"The winner of The Celebrity Traitors was unveiled in a dramatic finale on Thursday night. The hit BBC series' inaugural celebrity edition featured a line-up of contestants including comedian Stephen Fry, singer Paloma Faith and Olympian Tom Daley. Host Claudia Winkleman pitted a handful of secret traitors against faithfuls at Ardross Castle, a grand Highland property that is one of the reality TV show's biggest stars - including a challenge on the Strathspey Railway. The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century pile about 30 miles north of Inverness. It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland near the Easter Ross town of Alness. The property was built more than 170 years ago in a Scottish baronial style, a type of elaborate architecture featuring complex rooflines with turrets and fortress-like battlements. More than 200 years ago - long before the castle was built - the land at Ardross was owned by George Granville Leveson-Gower, the 1st Duke of Sutherland. He had a hunting lodge on the site where the castle stands today. The duke was a controversial figure in the Highland Clearances. In large parts of Sutherland, he had people cleared off land where they had lived for generations to make way for sheep farming and agricultural ""improvements"". Some families were moved to coastal villages, while others became emigrants and made difficult journeys to Canada to start new lives there. There is a statue of the duke on a hilltop north of Ardross. Known locally as The Mannie, and overlooking Golspie, it has been the target of vandalism and even attempts . Years later the estate at Ardross was bought by Sir Alexander Matheson. Matheson made his fortune . He was an MP and an instrumental figure in the building of railways in the Highlands. And he had the castle, so familiar to Traitors fans today, constructed. Ross and Cromarty Heritage Society says that from 1847, about 400 workers were involved in the property's construction. They built 30 rooms and laid out the castle's extensive grounds. According to Ardross Castle's website, Sir Alexander also improved estate workers' housing. After Sir Alexander's death, the country house and its estate was sold to businessman and philanthropist Charles William Dyson Perrins. His grandfather William Perrins, in partnership with John Wheeley Lea, created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce. The Perrins family was also involved in the production of Royal Worcester porcelain. Charles William Dyson Perrins joined the family business after four years serving in the Highland Light Infantry. He and his family were annual visitors to Ardross Castle. The Perrins' ownership came to an end in the 1930s and various parts of the estate was sold off. In 1983, the castle was bought by the McTaggart family and they still own it today. While not run as a hotel, the property is available as a wedding venue - its popularity undoubtedly boosted by its appearance in The Traitors. In 2023, Loukas Tsarmaklis, a director of Ardross Castle Enterprises, told they ""try to keep a low profile... but there is no chance now."" ""This has put us on the map and helped local B&Bs, tradesmen, taxi drivers, cleaners. It was a big operation for this part of the world,"" he added.

Strathspey Railway is a volunteer-run company that operates a 10-mile (16km) route between Aviemore and Broomhill, via Boat of Garten. The heritage railway's line is part of the former Inverness and Perth Junction Railway, later called the Highland, which linked Aviemore with Forres. It is one of only a handful of former lines to be preserved following rail closures in the 1960s. The company has a fleet of steam and diesel locomotives which are run and maintained by a mix of volunteers and a small number of paid staff. It has frequently been involved in restoration projects, . The Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 engine - No. 46464 - was one of five built in Crewe, Cheshire, in 1950. It spent most of its working life based at Dundee Tay Bridge Steam Shed 62B, operating on services in Angus and Fife. Last week, Strathspey Railway said it had received a £1m donation from a mystery American donor . The railway runs trips throughout the year and is now operating to a winter timetable, which includes a festive Elf Express. Joining Claudia Winkleman in the castle were .

China US,How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor,2025-11-10T00:17:37.214Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yl88wd3lo,"You probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been the in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa, The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead. This American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. ""The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,"" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. ""This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market."" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. ""We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity"". Sepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. ""To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,"" she says. ""So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants."" Ms Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. ""There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,"" she says. ""You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc."" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative. One US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa is in South Africa's Gauteng province. ""It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,"" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa. However, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick. He argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough. ""Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,"" says Prof Branstetter. Going forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haihambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."
China US,China launches new aircraft carrier in naval race with the US,2025-11-07T08:00:25.247Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e0yx39g5o,"China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds. Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships. China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up. The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong. State media hailed the Fujian as a ""major milestone"" in the development of China's navy. The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian. The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea. State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: ""Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!"""
China US,Devastating toxic spill seen as test of whether African countries will stand up to China,2025-12-02T06:02:35.007Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nly288j4o,"Even before the dam collapsed, Lamec did not feel safe working at the copper mine. ""If our work protective gear gets damaged, it is not always replaced,"" he tells us. ""We have to take a risk and use it again."" He is talking to the BBC in a car on a quiet backroad near a village in northern Zambia, too nervous to speak to us in public or to use his real name, for fear that speaking to the press might cost him his livelihood. When he turned up for his shift one day in February, he tells us, he found that one of the dams at the Chinese-owned mine had been closed. The tailings dam - used to store toxic by-products from the copper mining process, including heavy metals like arsenic, mercury and lead - had collapsed into a tributary connected to the Kafue, Zambia's longest river and a major drinking water source. At least 50,000 tonnes of acidic debris spilled out into the surrounding waterways and farmland, according to the government. Some environmentalists, however, claim as much as 1.5 million tonnes was spilled, with one expert saying a full clean-up could take longer than a decade. The spill has killed the fish around the towns of Chambishi and Kitwe, made the water undrinkable and destroyed crops, farmers have told the BBC. There are fears that, now the rainy season has started, heavy metals still sitting in the mud will further infiltrate the land and waterways, causing a second wave of pollution. Toxic metals that can cause kidney damage and cancers, as well as gastric and intestinal issues, could be carried downstream to the capital, Lusaka, says Dr Mweene Himwiinga, a senior lecturer at Zambia's Copperbelt University. The Chinese embassy in Lusaka disputes the scale of the damage and told the BBC it welcomed the establishment of an independent investigation into the incident. The Zambian government, it said, had reported that the pollution was contained to a confined area, water acidity levels had returned to normal limits and that ongoing checks showed no lasting public-health risks. Lamec, like his country Zambia, finds himself in a difficult position. The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse. More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment. In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households. They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement. The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories. ""All eyes are on this case,"" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. ""Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved."" People found it hard to believe at first ""because something of this scale had not happened before,"" he adds. The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining. Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China. But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba. ""There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,"" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. ""We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue."" Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese. Between 2000 and 2023, 49 African countries are believed to have signed $182.3bn (£139.4bn) worth of loans with Chinese lenders. In Copperbelt Province, Lamec tells us he was really broken by the spill affecting his family. ""We were told that the waterways now had acid in them, and that we were not supposed to use the water."" For two weeks after the spill, Lamec says he and his family weren't allowed to use the local water until it had been sprayed with lime to help reduce the acidity. He took the job at the dam because, he says, he has no other way to make a living, but now feels conflicted about working there. Copper mining has been the economic backbone of this region for more than a century. The metal makes up 70% of Zambia's exports and accounts for 15% of its GDP. The industry is set to grow further, with plans to more than triple production in Zambia by 2031, according to plans laid out by the government last year. In the village of Twalima, it has been a struggle to grow anything since the spill, say farmers Abigail Namtowe, 28, and Frederick Bwalya, 72. Farming was the main source of food and income for Ms Namtowe's family, and her six year-old daughter is now very hungry and malnourished, she told us. ""I've tried to grow my maize, I've tried everything so the hunger won't kill my child, but it's too much."" Mr Bwalya has lived in Twalima for 33 years. Strong and energetic, we meet him working on his farm which he tends to daily. ""Farming is not going well because the soil is not clean,"" he says. He also describes a severe pain in his leg which won't go away and makes it difficult for him to move. ""The doctor says the contaminated water could be causing this,"" he adds. Sino Metals has promised to build a borehole away from the contaminated stream at the bottom of his farm, he says, but that hasn't happened yet. He believes that water deeper underground would be safer. The stream used to be teeming with fish, say Mr Bwalya and his neighbours, adding that since the spill, there haven't been any. The BBC asked Sino Metals about the alleged promise to build boreholes on the land of affected farmers. We also put Lamec's allegations that he does not feel safe working at the company, but the firm did not respond. Fifty kilometres (31 miles) away from Frederick Bwalya's village, in Kamwatimpa, we saw schoolchildren swimming in a tributary of the Kafue river. Some mothers - still worried about the pollution - said they had told their children not to go into the water. But the government says it sampled 21 sites across Copperbelt Province in September, and that the concentrations of heavy metals were within national safe limits. Now the rainy season has taken hold, the power to stop a second wave of pollution seeping into the soil, and carrying heavy metals down the river to the rest of the country, is in the hands of the government and Sino Metals. The clean-up has been delayed by issues between the consultants hired to assess the damage and Sino Metals, Dr Chibamba told the BBC, when asked why some of this work hadn't been done earlier. Meanwhile, Dr Himwiinga warns that failure to deal with the situation ""may be catastrophic"". ""They [the heavy metals] could be there for years, and their effects could be felt for a very long period of time, by farmers... who rely on that water to irrigate their crops,"" she says. ""According to research carried out by Copperbelt University, this could go on for even over 10 years, unless remediation efforts are put in place."" The Zambian government says it is aware of this and has instructed Sino Metals to put mitigations in place to stop secondary pollution - including planting trees, to bring down levels of pollution in the air and soil, as well as spreading lime to reduce acidity. These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities. Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment. Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company. One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments. But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries. ""The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,"" says Prof Chan. ""The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans."" Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa. African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says. ""It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world."" African governments are ""not always getting it right"", he says, however ""this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make."" For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was ""grossly unfair"" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial. ""Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,"" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says. ""It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa."""
China US,Louvre to hike ticket prices for most non-EU tourists by 45%,2025-11-28T08:59:32.121Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd4llgrego,"Ticket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday. From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery. The museum's security and management have faced criticism since , when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes. An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure. From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum. Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC. The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added. The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum. There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026. Macron also said the to deal with overcrowding. Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo. The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros. Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics . The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration."
China US,Shein and Temu face calls for investigation over claims of stealing US designs,2025-12-02T09:52:28.694Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lvzeyk21vo,"Online retailers Shein and Temu are facing increased pressure in the US after two senior politicians pushed for investigations, including into claims of forced labour and intellectual property (IP) theft. In Texas, the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a probe into allegations of forced labour and the use of unsafe materials at Shein. At a national level, Senator Tom Cotton called for a federal investigation into possible IP theft at both Shein and Temu, which he labelled ""Communist Chinese"" platforms. Shein said it took concerns raised about its business practices seriously. Temu did not immediately respond for comment. Shein said in a statement that it would co-operate with the investigation and that it welcomed ""constructive engagement"" with Paxton. It said in response to Cotton's letter that the company continues to invest in protecting the rights of designers worldwide. ""We are constantly improving our internal processes to better protect creators,"" said Shein. The retailer is headquartered in Singapore but most of the goods sold on its platform are made in China, where it was founded. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, Cotton - senior Republican from Arkansas - said that millions of packages from China now sit in US warehouses after Washington changed its rules on low-cost shipments in August. , a global tariff exemption widely used by buyers of low-cost goods. The change subjected shipments to levies and stricter customs checks. The new regulations gives the Department of Justice and Homeland Security a ""golden opportunity"" to act, said Cotton, a key ally of Trump and a vocal critic of China. Designers and small American brands have accused Shein of systematically copying their original creations, often just days after launch, and selling them at a fraction of the price, he said. Cotton also accused Temu of carrying ""sophisticated and deceptive fakes"" on its platform, which has hundreds of millions of users. Cotton cited a which found a significant proportion of items that its researchers bought on Shein and Temu were likely counterfeits. Separately, Paxton from Texas said that numerous reports have raised serious concerns about Shein's alleged reliance on forced labour, and claims of the use of unsafe materials and deceptive marketing. The brand has been under scrutiny over the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business and the on its site. The Republican lawyer said the investigation will assess if Shein's practices violate Texas law by allegedly using hazardous materials and if it has misled consumers about ethical sourcing. The probe will also examine Shein's data collection practices, he added. ""I will not allow cheap, dangerous, foreign goods to flood America and jeopardise our health,"" said Paxton online. Shein also faces calls by the European Union to curb sales of childlike sex dolls and weapons on its third-party marketplace place after . Temu is also being investigated in France over the spread of harmful content accessible to young people. Shein is not the only firm under fire by Paxton, who, like Cotton, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. He and deceiving parents about the dangers that the platform is said to pose to young gamers. Roblox has denied the claims, which it said are based on ""misrepresentations"" of its online gaming platform."

Bristol-based Aardman Studios, famed for its stop-motion and clay modelling animation, was founded by school friends David Sproxton and Peter Lord. The ""Cracking Exhibition Gromit: 50 Years of Aardman in Bristol"" is due to take over the M Shed next summer, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, iconic characters and a celebration of the studio's ""deep-rooted connection"" to the city Ngaio Harding-Hill, from Aardman, said: ""2026 is such an important year for Aardman and the anniversary would never have been complete without a celebration in our home city."" ""The programme of experiences with M Shed and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery will be a real highlight celebrating the importance of Bristol, its people and creative connection to the studio over the last 50 years,"" he added. As part of the collaboration, ""Aardman treasures"" will also be hidden throughout Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Bristol Museums head of culture, Philip Walker, said they were ""absolutely delighted"" to be working with Aardman on this exciting collaboration. ""It's a brilliant celebration of Bristol's creative spirit and a tribute to the imagination and humour that Aardman has shared with the world for half a century,"" he said. ""We can't wait to showcase 50 years of clay, creativity, and cracking adventures."" The first Wallace And Gromit film was 1989's A Grand Day Out, which was followed by The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit and A Matter Of Loaf And Death.

China US,'I am devastated': Hong Kong residents in disbelief after fire destroys blocks of flats,2025-11-27T15:03:14.208Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjnlx1g6yo,"""When you get closer the heat rises and you can feel it and the smoke is really heavy."" Student Thomas Liu was one of many people drawn to the scene of a deadly fire that tore through much of the eight-block Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district. At least 83 people have died so far in the devastating blaze that began on Wednesday, and with hundreds still missing, this number is expected to rise. The cause is not yet known, but three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to flammable materials, including mesh and plastic sheets, that may have allowed the fire to spread quickly. ""It's a disaster,"" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. ""Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,"" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. The fire was gradually being contained but officials said they did not know when it would be fully extinguished. Flames could be seen coming from individual apartments as many people watched on in silence. One woman said her friends live inside the building and she was waiting to hear if they managed to get out. Harry Cheung, who has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for more than 40 years, told Reuters he heard ""a very loud noise"" and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. ""I immediately went back to pack up my things,"" the 66-year-old resident said. ""I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight because I probably won't be able to go back home."" A woman in her sixties, whose surname is Kam and who lives in the adjacent Kwong Fuk Estate, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that several of her friends living in Wang Fuk Court had been accounted for - but not all. One friend has daily afternoon naps and may have been sleeping when the fire broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT), Ms Kam said, adding that the woman's daughters have not yet been able to contact her. Another resident, 65-year-old Jason Kong, told Reuters that a neighbour called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. ""I am devastated. There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do. I hope the government can help us to settle down after this."" An elderly woman who lives in one of the affected blocks told the BBC she was not at home when the fire broke out but that she was worried about her apartment because it was not insured. ""I'm very upset that I have no home to go to now,"" she said. While the cause of the fire that engulfed the multiple high-rise blocks was unknown, police say a mesh material and plastic sheets were found outside the buildings - both of which are not believed to be fireproof. Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows. These materials may have caused the fire to spread more quickly, said police. Some people have expressed anger that such a massive fire could have happened and criticised the response. ""When there's a wildfire, they will deploy helicopters and drop water bombs, but why is there no such deployment and how can they leave other buildings burning?"" Ms Poon, another resident of Wang Fuk Court, who is in her sixties, asked. ""The community is so close to the fire station and we thought the fire could be put out soon, but now the fire has spread. I'm so disappointed,"" she told the SCMP. Ms Poon noted that she had been given no instructions from the government on where to seek help. The BBC spoke to some Tai Po residents who had brought supplies to the victims and affected residents - including dozens of blankets and heat packs. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said government departments were assisting residents affected by the fire. When asked about their feelings about the fire, the residents said ""the government is incompetent"" and that they were ""immensely heartbroken"". ""We don't want to see any more casualties,"" said one."
China US,COP30: Five key takeaways from a deeply divisive climate summit ,2025-11-23T00:10:18.355Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp84m16mdm1o,"In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive. Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated. The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change. Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the ""COP of truth"". The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted. And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting. Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible. So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP. The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations. Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that. While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return. Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas. To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion. It made matters worse. Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy. The EU were given short shrift by major producers. ""We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,"" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer. Ouch! Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse. Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP. These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain. They are the richest group of nations still in the but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour. While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of. The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft. The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the ""tripling"" word stayed in the text. So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in. ""Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,"" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics. ""This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union."" The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front. The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself. Two often heard positions: How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words? How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks? The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore. ""We can't discard it entirely,"" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News. ""But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far."" Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people. It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore. Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an ""implementation cop"" and put a lot of focus on the ""energy agenda"". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant. COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance. For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an ""orchestrated"" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G. 'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking. The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it. They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - ""unilateral"" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive. The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad. If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves. Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials. The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization. The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways. US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here. Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals. And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels. ""China kept a low political profile,"" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society. ""And they focussed on making money in the real world."" ""Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position."" to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

China US,Sixth-tier club contemplates second doc series,2025-11-23T12:32:40.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx5j096pxo,"A sixth-tier football club's owner says he is ""very close now to agreeing on series two"" of a documentary about his Sussex team. Eastbourne Borough Football Club has released the seven-episode Owning Eastbourne series on its YouTube channel. Cameras followed the club through the 2024-25 season, when the team lost in the National League South play-off semi-finals to Maidstone United. The club's owner Simon Leslie claims the first series of the documentary has ""had some really good interest"" from broadcasters since its release. It was broadcast on ReachTV, a channel shown in US airports, and the club is close to a deal to show the programme in China, according to Mr Leslie. The club owner told the BBC the documentary ""gives us an opportunity to share with people who want to get involved in what we're doing"". ""It's a very expensive business owning a football club,"" he said. ""I've had very broad shoulders for nearly three years and I need people to come in and support me, and help me, and be part of this journey."" He said viewers get ""a full, unfiltered view of behind the scenes, in the changing room, in the boardroom of what it's like in non-league football"". ""What's been really great over the last couple days is some of the comments have been incredibly positive,"" Mr Leslie said. ""There have been some less so comments as well, but it is like nothing else."" So far this season, Eastbourne have struggled in the National League South and currently find themselves in the relegation zone. Matt Gray, who was appointed in the summer, was sacked by the club in October and replaced by Tommy Widdrington for his second spell as manager of the club. Mr Leslie said the season so far had been ""a rollercoaster arc of emotions"" but he felt the team was ""on the up""."
China US,Dutch government suspends intervention into chipmaker Nexperia,2025-11-19T15:53:52.309Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p7j83rn1o,"The Dutch government has suspended its intervention at Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, following talks with China. The Hague over ""serious governance shortcomings"" and concerns over the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods. In response, Beijing blocked exports of the firm's chips. However, on Wednesday the Dutch government said it would halt its original decision following ""constructive talks"" with Beijing. China said it welcomed the move, adding it was a ""first step in the right direction towards a proper resolution"". Nexperia is a major supplier of basic computer chips to the car industry, and shortages have threatened global supply chains. A shortage of computer chips used in various electronic goods and cars would hugely impact the ability of manufacturers to make their products. The decision by the Dutch government will ease tensions between the European Union and China, which have been mounting in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. Vincent Karremans, economic affairs minister, said that he considered it right to suspend action, made under the Goods Availability Act, ahead of further talks with the Chinese government. ""We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement. The Dutch government said it originally invoked the Act following concerns ""from actions attributed to the now-suspended CEO, involving the improper transfer of product assets, funds, technology, and knowledge to a foreign entity"". ""These actions ran counter to the interests of the company, its shareholders, and Dutch and European strategic autonomy and security of supply,"" it said. In October, a Dutch court ordered the removal of ex-Nexperia CEO and Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng, citing alleged mismanagement. The Dutch government added that its decision had aimed to prevent a situation in which chips could become unavailable in an emergency. In December last year, the US government placed Wingtech, which owns Nexperia, on its so-called ""entity list"", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. Following the Dutch government's reversal, the Beijing acknowledged the move but said it was ""still a step away from addressing the root cause of the global semiconductor supply chain turmoil and chaos"". ""Furthermore, the erroneous ruling by the corporate court, spearheaded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, to strip Wingtech of its control over Nexperia remains a key obstacle to resolving the issue,"" it added. Wingtech has said it will fight the decision. Following the latest move, a spokesperson for Wingtch said the company ""strongly"" rejected the allegations against its chief executive. ""To date, no proof has been provided,"" it added. ""If the Dutch government is sincere about solving the problem, the Ministry should now file a letter with the Enterprise Chamber, explicitly withdrawing its support for the proceedings. ""These proceedings form a threat to the continuity of Nexperia B.V. and therefore for the economic security of the Netherlands and Europe - which is the exact same argument the Dutch government made previously in support of judicial intervention."""
China US,Strange pillar of light linked to Chinese rocket,2025-12-06T12:02:15.539Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98ze8jx7o,"A glowing streak spotted in the sky on Thursday morning was most likely caused by a Chinese rocket, experts say. Witnesses reported a bright, linear trail visible around dawn and dusk from several locations. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the US, said: ""It was definitely the Chinese Zhuque-3 rocket making its first test flight. ""It passed over the UK and northern Europe at around 05:00 GMT at the end of its first orbit, following launch from China at 04:02 GMT. Chinese upper stages have been previously observed to make long, linear propellant-dump trails."" Ellie Jarvis, from Clovelly, said: ""I've never seen anything like it. At first, I wondered whether it might be something like an aurora or a natural phenomenon - like a light pillar. ""I tried to see whether there was something shining a beam of light from across the bay, or perhaps from a ship - but that didn't  seem likely as the light seemed to be so high in the sky."" A jet contrail was also considered but dismissed because the trail appeared too widespread. Similar vertical light effects, known as light pillars, can sometimes form when high-altitude ice crystals reflect low-angle sunlight, creating unusual atmospheric displays."
China US,What we know about the Hong Kong apartment fires,2025-11-28T09:47:59.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxe9r7wjgro,"Hong Kong's deadliest fire in more than 60 years ripped through a high-rise public housing complex in the city's north-east this week, killing at least 128 people. Dozens more remain missing, with 79 people confirmed injured and and 89 bodies yet to be identified. Now, as the last flames are extinguished and the high-rise blocks smoulder against the city's urban skyline, attention has turned to the cause of the deadly fire, and the factors that allowed it to so rapidly spread. Many Hong Kongers have described it as a ""man-made disaster"". Authorities have attributed the ferocity of the blaze to Styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks - while also noting that fire alarms in all eight housing blocks were found to be not working effectively. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire, according to local media reports, and an investigation has been launched. What initially caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far. The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT). Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, each 31 storeys high. Seven have been affected by the fire, Tai Po district councillor Mui Siu-fung told BBC Chinese. Built in 1983, the tower blocks were undergoing renovations when the fire broke out. Tai Po is a residential district in the northern part of Hong Kong, near the city of Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland. The complex provides 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of the people who lived in the Wang Fuk Court housing complex are at least 65, or older, according to the latest census. Some of them have lived in the subsidised public housing estate since it was built. The cause of the fire is unknown, but Hong Kong Security Chief Tang Ping-Keung on Friday attributed its rapid spread to styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks. A preliminary investigation previously found that the blaze had escalated unusually fast, and police had revealed that a mesh material and plastic sheets - both of which are believed to not be fireproof - was found on the outside of the buildings. Police have arrested three men aged between 52 and 68 on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the deadly blaze. Two of them are directors of a construction firm while the other is an engineering consultant. A police spokesperson on Thursday said investigators were looking into the alleged actions, or failure to act, of the firm's top officials. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" said the spokesperson. Authorities on Friday further noted that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working effectively - confirming prior reports from some residents who said they did not sound when the blaze broke out. This was Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years. Within 40 minutes of first being reported it was declared a level four alarm - but it was raised to a level five, the highest in severity, about three and a half hours later. Local media had earlier reported that explosions could be heard inside the building and fire hoses could not easily reach the higher levels. The ferocity of the heat had prevented firefighters from entering the buildings. Officials told reporters on Friday that even after the fire had been put out, some sections of the buildings' remained above 200C (392F). The city's fire department on Thursday said that the combination of high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments made rescue operations difficult Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have an average living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out. Hundreds were evacuated to temporary shelters, and some were allocated emergency housing units. More than 2,311 firefighters took part in rescue operations, with 12 sustaining injuries during the response. Authorities said 391 fire engines were also mobilised and 188 ambulances dispatched. Among the dead is firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, who was with the service at Sha Tin Fire Station for nine years. The fire service says it lost contact with him at 15:30 local time, and about half an hour later, found that he had collapsed. He was taken to hospital but declared dead shortly after. ""I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,"" said Andy Yeung, director of the fire service. One resident, Mr Chung, told the BBC he got a panicked phone call on Wednesday afternoon from his wife saying she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Mr Chung said he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. to accommodate residents who were evacuated, the government said. The South China Morning Post reported that one of them - at Tung Cheong Street Sports Centre - was full, and residents were being directed to other shelters. Another, the Kwong Fuk Community Hall, which is just over the road from the housing estate, was deemed unsafe. Evacuees were moved to another shelter, further away. BBC Chinese reporter Gemini Cheng saw elderly residents, some using walking sticks or wheelchairs, arriving at some of the shelters. At least 900 people are taking shelter in such temporary facilities, news agency AFP reports, quoting Lee. Six schools in Tai Po will remain closed on Thursday, the Education Bureau announced, . An emergency monitoring and support centre is in operation to manage the impact of the fire, security secretary Tang Ping-keung said in a statement. A hotline for the public to ask about casualties has been set up by Hong Kong police. The tower blocks at Wang Fuk Court are covered in bamboo scaffolding and green construction netting, right up to the rooftops, because they are undergoing renovations. As mentioned earlier, authorities have attributed the quick spread of the fire to materials used in the renovation, such as mesh netting, plastic sheeting and styrofoam. It's still unclear how the fire began, but no matter its cause, proper netting on the buildings' exterior would have been key to preventing its spread, Jason Poon, chairman of construction NGO Chinat Monitor, told news outlet Initium Media. Substandard netting could cause the fire to spread rapidly, he added. Another engineer told Initium Media he believes that the vast majority of mesh netting used in construction across Hong Kong is not made of fire-retardant material. Cardboard, debris and paint thinner is also often found on the scaffolding, which along with dry weather could hasten the spread of fire, the engineer said. One fire safety expert the BBC spoke to said the bamboo scaffolding - a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. Authorities have not mentioned scaffolding as having caused or fuelled the rapid spread of the fire. Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong, although reports said these were caused by falls and other safety failures, rather than fires. Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were ""relatively old"" - they were built in the 1980s - so ""the glass windows are not that fire resilient"". ""The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane... [which makes it] very easy to be broken by the flames and the flames can then penetrate through the facade."""
China US,'Hang in there': Agonising wait for the missing after Hong Kong blaze,2025-11-28T07:11:58.245Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9y0pjzmdro,"""Hang in there."" Those were the last words Mr Chung said to his wife after a huge 's Tai Po district. It was around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday when he got her panicked phone call. She said she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Firefighters in the Chinese territory took nearly 24 hours to tame the blaze that tore through seven tower blocks, including theirs, claiming at least 128 lives so far. Nearly 300 people are still unaccounted for - Mr Chung's wife is among the many missing. The BBC spoke to several residents who were not at home or managed to escape in time. Some, like Mr Chung, have waited outside the burning buildings, hoping against hope. There was no alarm warning them of danger, all of them told the BBC. Mr Chung, 45, and his brother, spent Wednesday night on the street asking the firefighters dozens of times for updates - but they couldn't give them any. Throughout, he said, he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. The Chungs moved in a decade ago to Wang Cheong House – the first of the seven tower blocks at Tai Po to go up in flames. When the fire started, Mr Chung says, the smoke on the 23rd floor, where they lived, turned so thick within just 10 minutes, that his wife couldn't find her way out. The cause of the fire is still unclear, but authorities believe renovations using flammable material and scaffolding helped spread what has now become the deadliest blaze in Hong Kong in six decades. It engulfed seven of the eight buildings - comprising 1,800 units - in Wang Fuk Court, a subsidised housing estate built in 1983 to the north of Hong Kong Island, where the city's wealthy live. Nearly 40% of Wang Fuk Court's residents are aged 65 or above, according to the 2021 census. It's partly why it's feared so many residents were trapped - because they are older and less likely to have made it out quickly. Ms Fung, 40, has not been able to find her mother yet. She and her parents moved to the estate only last year - for its views of the ocean. Her father and she were at work when the fire started. Ms Fung received a call from her neighbour, who said she was hiding with Ms Fung's mother inside a toilet. But they lost contact at midnight on Wednesday. All the same, she is holding on to hope: ""We will think about our next steps after my mum comes out."" She sought help from police, but she says she was furious when they called her back to ask if it was possible her mother could have somehow escaped. She demanded to know how that was possible: ""You know much better than us how badly burnt Wang Cheong House is!"" On social media, posts about missing elderly relatives, children and pets have been circulating endlessly. A desperate mother wrote: ""I still can't find my baby girl. It's nearly 30 hours and there has been no updates from the fire service…"" In a later post, she said: ""I am afraid there is no hope."" The devastation has spotlighted the expensive and controversial renovations at Wang Fuk Court, which cost about HK$330M ($42.2M; £32.1M), with each household having to pay between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000. Many residents had opposed the project because of the costs but it went ahead. Authorities have now arrested three executives from the construction firm, citing ""gross negligence"".  Police say the mesh and plastic sheets used on the scaffolding were substandard, and that windows were wrapped in highly flammable styrofoam. Grandma Chan, a long-time resident, says she had been scared since the renovation began last year, because of its scale and she had occasionally noticed a burning smell. ""Will anything happen if I stay home?"" she once asked her daughter. The 72-year-old was alone at home when the fire started but she only found out about it when her daughter, who was travelling in South Korea, called. She says she made it out alive because her daughter told her to flee. It was the same for 82-year-old Grandma Wu. When the fire broke out, she was playing mahjong, a popular game, with her neighbours. They were warned not by an alarm, but by their husbands calling them. But she said they continued the game because there were three buildings between theirs and Wang Cheong House, where the fire broke out. Then came a second call, saying the fire had reached their building. The women immediately took the lift and reached the ground floor. Surrounded by the smell of burning buildings, Grandma Wu looked up to find that seven of eight buildings within the complex were in flames. Although she was safe, she stayed outside, with her helper, overnight. She says her son wanted to take her to his home but she refused. ""I have been living in this flat for 42 years,"" she says. ""I told my son not to come, and I would not go anywhere. I have to sit here and watch how this goes. My heart will only be at peace after the fire is extinguished."" When that happens, a new battle begins for many residents who have poured a life's worth of savings into buying these homes. Kyle Ho, 32, moved into the complex with his retired parents three years ago. Despite the subsidised price, they needed a mortgage to afford a home at Wang Fuk Court. Now, they don't know what comes next. The Hong Kong government has announced cash relief of HK$10,000 for displaced families, and a HK$300m assistance fund. That could be some relief for Mr Ho. ""The worst-case scenario is that we have lost our flat,"" he says. ""But the most important thing is that all of us are safe. We are luckier than many other families."" For those like Mr Chung, the wait continues as authorities insist they have not ruled out rescuing people. ""We haven't given up,"" they said earlier on Thursday. Mr Chung, too, is determined to find his wife. ""I want to rescue her - whether she's alive or gone."""
China US,Cats became our companions much later than you think,2025-11-27T20:02:21.954Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8dvdp9gn7o,"In true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place. A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. ""They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,"" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford. ""That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago."" All modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat. How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists. To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats. The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa. ""Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,"" said Prof Larson. This fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies. Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought. They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China. Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica. And in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene. These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years. The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially ""commensal"" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. ""Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,"" she said. Leopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia. Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s. The research is published in the journal, and in ."
China US,"Graduate jobs under threat from AI, PwC boss says",2025-11-21T02:34:57.601Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm272510e6jo,"The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) may eventually lead to fewer entry-level graduates being hired, the boss of accountancy giant PwC has told the BBC. However, global chairman Mohamed Kande said AI was not behind recent job cuts at the firm, adding that the company actually needed to hire hundreds of new AI engineers but was struggling to find them. But some observers say the technology itself threatens thousands of junior jobs across the professional services industry. Speaking on the sidelines of a business summit in Singapore, Mr Kande also said big changes in the global economy, such as US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, had been good for the firm's consulting business. He also addressed the company's suspension in China last year over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande, promising that the same mistakes ""would not happen again"". Headquartered in London, PwC is one of the Big Four accountancy firms. It provides a range of services, such as financial auditing, consulting and tax advice for business clients around the world. According to Mr Kande, advising them on how to integrate AI into their operations will be at the heart of the firm's future business strategy, even as the rapidly advancing technology affects its own hiring plans. Firms who would have previously hired PwC consultants to sift through data and documents may now use AI models instead, turning weeks of costly work into mere minutes. Every year, the company hires thousands of new graduates in entry-level positions - including 1,300 in the UK and 3,200 in the US last year - but it recently dropped long-term plans to continue increasing its headcount. In 2021, PwC said it wanted to hire 100,000 people over the course of five years - but Mr Kande said this would no longer be possible. ""When we made the plans to hire that many people, the world looked very, very different,"" he said. ""Now we have artificial intelligence. We want to hire, but I don't know if it's going to be the same level of people that we hire - it will be a different set of people."" Last year, PwC cut more than 5,600 roles across its worldwide operation. The boss of the company's UK business has previously spoken about reducing graduate recruitment, admitting that AI was ""certainly reshaping roles"". At a global level, however, Mr Kande insisted that the AI boom was an ""exciting time"" for creating new jobs. ""We are looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers today to help us drive our AI agenda, but we just cannot find them,"" he said. Businesses around the world may be facing challenges adapting to AI, but in the meantime PwC appears to have benefited from the broader uncertainty in the global economy, largely fuelled by President Trump's extensive use of tariffs. ""We are receiving a lot of calls from many companies around the world asking how to navigate the current environment,"" said Mr Kande. ""It's been good for us. We need to remain relevant to our clients and we have to be in these discussions, which we are."" However, the company took a huge reputational blow last year, when over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande. The firm went bust after amassing debts of more than $300bn (£230bn) and has been at the centre of a ruinous housing crisis that continues to damage lives and livelihoods in China. The country's Securities Regulatory Commission found that PwC, as the auditor, had ""covered up and even condoned"" financial fraud at Evergrande. Mr Kande, whose tenure as global chairman began after Evergrande went bankrupt, said PwC no longer faced any restrictions in China. ""Let me tell you - we changed many of our people, implemented new quality management systems and introduced new governance systems,"" he said. ""My focus has been to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."""
China US,Meta accused of letting AI sellers 'run rampant',2025-11-29T07:01:17.149Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz90d4q0o,"Facebook owner Meta has been accused of allowing misleading companies to ""run rampant"" on its platforms, as dozens of people say they have fallen victim to sellers using AI-generated adverts. More than 60 people contacted the BBC after we revealed unscrupulous foreign firms were . Some said they had been targeted by ads on Facebook and Instagram, and consumer guide Which? said businesses were using the platforms to ""spread their lies furthest and widest"". Meta said it had removed content by six companies, flagged by the BBC, which claimed to be based in England but were shipping cheap goods in from Asia. The tech giant said it did not allow fraudulent activity and worked closely with Stop Scams UK to protect users. One company removed from the platform is C'est La Vie, but had a returns address in China. Mabel & Daisy, which used AI generated pictures of a mother and daughter and claimed to sell ""timeless clothing"" from a shop in Bristol, has also been removed from the platform after it was exposed for selling cheap items from a base in Hong Kong. Other companies Meta says it is taking action against are clothing firms Sylvia & Grace, Chester & Claire, Harrison & Hayes and Olyndra London, as well as accessories business Omelia & Oliver Jewels. All have one-star reviews on Trustpilot with hundreds of customers saying they were duped into thinking they were buying from UK-based brands and received shoddy goods. Harrison & Hayes claimed to be a Manchester-based independent clothes shop with ""decades of experience"" but has a returns address to a central warehouse in China. It has used an AI-image of a shop front in the city which does not exist. Chester & Clare also uses an AI-generated image of a shopfront to market its business, which it claims has operated in London since 2005 but is actually based in the Netherlands and sells clothes shipped from China. Its terms of service states imagery, stories, characters and boutique locations ""may have been created using generate AI"" to ""enhance customer experience"". The BBC contacted all businesses but only got automated responses. Claire Brown was persuaded to buy two dresses for £73 from Luxe and Luna London, after ""constantly"" seeing the company's appealing adverts on Facebook. When the dresses arrived weeks later they were poorly made of flimsy material and ""looked awful"". ""It felt like a trusted brand after I'd seen it on Facebook so much, you see all these clothing collections and I liked what I saw,"" she said. Ms Brown, who works in tech marketing, said she reported the company to Meta but never got a response. The company has now stopped operating, with stating life had ""taken a devastating turn"" because of the death of a partner, an almost identical statement used by fake Birmingham jewellery business C'est La Vie. ""It makes me feel really cross, because I hate people being scammed and the websites are the kind of thing you would share with a friend,"" Claire added. ""There is a real lack of protection here for consumers."" Another Facebook user, Stuart, said he had reported a number of suspicious companies to the platform but was advised to ""influence the ads that you see by hiding ads and changing your ad preferences"" in its response. No other action was taken. Some of the fraudulent companies discovered by the BBC appear to be . That's where a third-party buys products from a wholesaler and sells them with a significant mark-up, having never seen the product themselves. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) recently that used images of roses, cobbled streets and the union jack when it was shipping goods from a warehouse in Asia. The regulator said it was continuing to take action on misleading adverts but said platforms like Facebook played an ""important role"" in maintaining ""responsible advertising"" and continued to engage with them on how best to prevent those that break the rules. Which? said Meta had allowed fake companies to ""run rampant on its platforms for too long"" and said it should be doing ""much more"" to stop scams and protect its users. Meta said it wanted users to report suspicious adverts on its platforms, which was an ""important signal"" to its review systems and could prompt a re-review of the advert while improving policies."
China US,Mum and baby fire plea sent to woman in Manchester,2025-11-28T19:08:29.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0nld5v87zo,"A woman in Manchester said she received pleas for help from a mum who was stuck in a Hong Kong flat fire with her newborn baby. At least after the and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. The cause of the fire remains unclear though officials said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread. Cherry moved to Manchester three years ago but she grew up in the complex and is still on a residents' group chat where she saw the pleas for help. Cherry said she did not sleep on Wednesday night. ""I felt really really sad because I knew I couldn't do anything,"" she said. ""I was seeing messages from people still in the fire asking for help, pleading to be saved. ""What I most strongly remember was a mother - she was in the fire with her three-month-old baby, messaging for help. She told us the address and said 'please help to save us'. ""A lot of people downstairs were writing support to her, telling her how to keep stable and calm until the firemen came."" Cherry told Radio Manchester that the mother and baby were rescued and were safe and well. ""They are in hospital for monitoring,"" she said. But Cherry said they were not the only residents who were trapped like this. Cherry said she believed ongoing maintenance work, flammable materials and a lack of working fire alarms were responsible for the scale of the tragedy. ""There is green mesh outside the building because of the maintenance work,"" she said. ""However in Hong Kong there is no understanding that this mesh needed to be fire resistant. ""The residents say they have tested the mesh nets and found out that the material was not fire resistant and they are angry. ""They are thinking about how they pay so much money but didn't get what they needed, didn't get anything to protect their lives."" Authorities are investigating the incident. ""It is too late now,"" said Cherry. ""I think what we should be doing is looking at how to prevent this happening again for a second time,"" she added. on suspicion of corruption over the renovation work at the complex.

China US,"Britain won't beat the US in AI race, says ex-Google scientist",2025-11-24T06:43:20.856Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e7mj0jmro,"A computer scientist who revolutionised the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has called for the UK to be ""brave"" in its pursuit of the technology. Llion Jones, who was part of the pioneering Google team that unlocked AI's ability to respond in a human-like form, warned against trying to compete with ""hyper-scalers"" in the United States and China. He said the ""sycophantic"" responses of the current wave of AI chatbots needed to be fixed. ""We need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you,"" he said. Mr Jones, who was raised in Bangor and Abergynolwyn in Gwynedd, north Wales, is one of the co-authors of , which introduced the Transformer architecture that put the ""T"" in ChatGPT. It was a breakthrough that now underpins the generative AI systems that are transforming business and everyday life. Still based in Tokyo, he is now the chief technology officer of Sakana AI, the firm he founded with another former Google researcher. His company focuses on speculative research into future uses of AI, something he claimed was ""unique"", as other big tech firms were focused on monetising the current wave of large language models. ""I do genuinely think that we are unique in that respect right now,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I'm trying to make the environment to give people the freedom to do the research they want, and I'm going to try and protect it as long as I can."" Mr Jones said governments in Cardiff and Westminster needed to accept the reality of a global race which was being won by America and China, and focus instead on different types of AI developments. ""I think a country like Wales, or even Britain in general, is not going to beat the hyper-scalers, right? They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs. ""It doesn't make any sense to be a part of that race, because you're not going to win. ""So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave."" He argued that ""something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research"". ""It's a bit of a longer bet, but if it pays off then you're back in the race, right?"" While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations. Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology. ""AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,"" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle. Some of the businesses at the event ""are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,"" he added. ""If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,"" Kyle said. He added that a 1% increase in small business productivity would generate £240bn worth of economic activity. AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to ""drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive"". It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology. Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government. But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales. There have been to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas. ""Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,"" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons. Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands. ""What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,"" he said. ""There's so much more benefit that comes from the modernisation of grid infrastructure. ""When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible."" Mr George warned Wales could ""lose out"" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions. Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant ""the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly"". While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots. ""They've become very sycophantic,"" he said. The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them. ""Unfortunately, humans love being told that they're right. ""This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.' ""So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you."""
China US,Trump's plan for Gaza backed by UN Security Council,2025-11-18T02:03:30.771Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpkgq4wllo,"The UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza. Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained. Adopting it was an ""important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire"", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan ""imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject"". ""Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,"" it added. Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas. Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be ""tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians"". The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force. Trump called the Security Council vote ""historic"" and said it was a way of ""acknowledging and endorsing"" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. ""This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for. Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text. The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to ""translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground"" and lead to ""a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution"". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution. The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented ""urgently and immediately"". Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it. Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution. The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a ""fragile, fragile first step"". Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack. More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
China US,'My heart breaks every time I'm called a hero' - Hong Kong fire survivor,2025-12-03T23:13:49.458Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2054rdv52o,"William Li has struggled with the label ""hero"" since helping his neighbours escape the fire which engulfed the Hong Kong block of flats he had called home since birth. Instead, he is haunted by guilt that he could have saved more people from the blaze at Wang Fuk Court, which left at least 159 people dead. ""My heart breaks every time someone calls me a hero,"" says the 40-year-old, breaking down in tears. A week on from the disaster, firefighters are still combing the complex of seven burnt-out high rises for the remains of 30 of Mr Li's neighbours - people who, like him, had the misfortune to be at home when the deadly fire began. What caused the fire to start, and why more people did not escape, is now the subject of an independent committee's investigation, ordered by Hong Kong's chief executive. Already, it has been revealed that non-fire resistant netting had been fitted around the building, and the fire alarms were not working properly. The fact alarms did not go off was the reason why Mr Li was not more worried when his wife called to tell him a fire had started in their building, Wang Cheong House. Instead of rushing, he spent almost 10 minutes packing belongings. But the moment he opened the door, the extent of the disaster was all too clear: he was engulfed in billowing smoke and had to retreat inside his flat. On the other end of the phone, his wife became hysterical, but Mr Li didn't have time to panic. He had to put wet towels under the door to stop the smoke from getting in, and tried to work out what to do next. It was then he heard voices in the corridor, where the air was now so dense with smoke he was unable to see who was calling out. Covering his face with a wet towel, he found two of his neighbours by touch, dragging the couple inside to the relative safety of his flat. In a neighbouring block, Bai Shui Lin was also trying to help her neighbours. The 66-year-old is thought to have saved at least three families, banging on their doors to warn them of the fire. Mrs Bai did not survive, however. Her sons identified her body at the weekend. ""If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,"" Yip Ka-Kui told the BBC's US partner, CBS. ""But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others."" Back in Mr Li's flat, the middle aged couple revealed they had heard another voice in the corridor: a domestic worker calling for an elderly woman. But now, the voice had gone quiet. This time, Mr Li was unable to help. ""I feel very guilty,"" he said. ""Some people weren't saved and I didn't open my door again and try to find them."" Mr Li does not know yet what happened to the voice in the corridor. Nine Indonesian and one Filipino domestic workers are reportedly among the dead, but others survived - including Rhodora Alcaraz, 28, who was trapped in another flat looking after her employer's three-month-old baby and elderly mother. She too has been hailed a hero for staying by their side. All three were rescued by firefighters eventually - but not before Ms Alcaraz had sent a series of voice messages to her sister. ""I'm feeling very weak. I can't breathe,"" she said in one of the clips, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Li and the couple - named in local media as the Chows - realised they too needed to escape. Several hours had elapsed, and their options were running out. One fire exit was blocked by the flames, while Mr Li's neighbour believed the other was locked. They decided not to jump out of the second floor window due to the intensity of the fire, and the constant explosions. A subsidiary of Danish company ISS, the property manager of Wang Fuk Court, has not responded to a BBC inquiry over reports that the emergency exit was locked. ""It was the first time I felt death had something to do with me,"" says Mr Li. That's why he started saying goodbye to friends one by one via WhatsApp: ""I can't escape,"" he told them. ""If something happens to me take care of my children. Look after yourselves."" About two and a half hours after the blaze began, firefighters finally reached them on an aerial ladder. Mrs Chow told HK01, a Hong Kong-based news outlet, that Mr Li insisted the firefighters should get them out first. ""We are older and told him he should leave first. He refused and said he was young and could handle this."" When the firefighters came back for him, Mr Li felt reluctant to leave his home, which was filled with fond memories and treasured collections of photography equipment and toys. ""The fire was telling me that I couldn't take anything away, that I had no right or power to stop it from devouring everything."" Mr Li reunited with his family at a nearby fast food restaurant. But after he'd reached hospital it took until the early hours of the morning for the true extent of the horror he'd endured to make itself felt. ""I no longer had any strength in me and when I got to the emergency room, my knees gave in. A burning smell lingered in my nose,"" he says. ""I really wanted to wash away the smell."" After being admitted to a ward at 03:00, Mr Li finally had the space to cry and start trying to process the ordeal he had gone through. ""When I had been to hospital before, I wanted to go home as soon as possible,"" he says. ""But this time when the nurse asked me [if I wanted to go home], I wasn't willing to leave. I felt like I was avoiding what I would have to face in the future."" He has however decided to face the trauma upfront – by doing as many interviews as he can. ""I hope many people will come forward to help find the truth,"" he says. ""I hope Wang Fuk Court residents will be given answers and justice."""
China US,Gardeners unearth stolen phones left by snatchers,2025-11-25T06:00:33.440Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vm6p3vjd2o,"Volunteers at a community garden in central London have been reuniting phone theft victims with their stolen devices after finding them buried in flower-beds. The Phoenix Garden, off Shaftesbury Avenue in Covent Garden, has seen snatchers stash stolen phones in its grounds due to its proximity to the West End, in an issue first reported by . Garden volunteers said they collected the phones from bushes and flower-beds and handed them to their owners or the police. As a result, fewer devices have been unearthed in recent weeks. Louise Gates, Phoenix Garden manager, said she often found phones ""thrown over the fence from the night before"" when she unlocked the garden in the morning. ""Some of our volunteers have dug up phones wrapped in tin foil,"" Ms Gates added. Tinfoil is often used by phone snatchers to stop the device's location being detected. It is believed that snatchers, often on electric bikes around hotspot areas like Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, have been temporarily stashing the phones in the garden for collection at a later date. Ms Gates said some of the theft victims had arrived at the garden after tracking their device's signal through Apple's Find My app. Ms Gates said if she could find the emergency contact information on the phone, she called the number provided. ""They're all really so grateful, which is nice,"" she said. ""Other times I charge it up, but nobody rings, I don't know who it belongs to or I can't find them on social media, so I just take it to the police station."" Ron Chenery, a volunteer of two years, said finding phones was a regular occurrence. ""Most of us love the garden so much, we're constantly out in the fresh air. If we see something we hand it in,"" he said. Community worker Elliot Hughes, who helps local students access the garden and get into nature, said it was important to teach young people about the wider risks of phone theft across the capital. ""The best we can do is give awareness"" he said. ""There's young people now, walking around central London on their phones, in the middle of the street, which are essentially £1,000 computers. ""So [I am] just highlighting to them maybe the things they shouldn't be doing."" A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said local officers had stepped up patrols in the area to identify potential phone snatching offenders. ""By intensifying our efforts we're catching more perpetrators and protecting people from having their phone stolen in the capital and have reduced theft by 16% since April. ""We're also dismantling organised crime groups suspected of large-scale phone theft."" The force called on phone companies including Apple and Samsung for security improvements that would make stolen phones harder to sell."
China US,Putin says Russia ready to supply 'uninterrupted' fuel to India ,2025-12-05T12:50:31.387Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g482m3yyzo,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide ""uninterrupted shipments"" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil. Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow. President Donald Trump has imposed , arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies. Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a ""peaceful solution"" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas ""Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,"" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on ""the side of peace"", welcoming efforts to find a ""lasting"" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the ""connectivity"" of Russia and India was a ""major priority"" for India. In recent months, India-US ties have hit an as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"" at the time. In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US. ""The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,"" he asked. Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May. The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture. Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia. Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said. No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry. Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years. Modi said that ""energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership"", but made no specific reference to oil. India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions. Putin also referenced a ""flagship project"": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with. In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being ""reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms"". Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a ""more just"" and ""multi-polar"" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations."
China US,Zambian-American influencer sentenced to 18 months for hate speech,2025-12-02T14:58:51.583Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqnklqge7o,"A Zambian-American influencer and political vlogger has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech for making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema. Zambian-born Ethel Chisono Edwards, who also holds US citizenship and works as an estate agent in New York, has a large following across various social media accounts. Known as ""One Boss Lady"", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years. The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral. She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments. But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common. Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year. She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred. Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential. He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment. He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf. ""I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,"" it said. Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona. The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest. Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence. The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech. Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws. In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema."
China US,Namibia loses bid to overturn ban on rhino horn trade,2025-12-05T14:24:32.464Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30j7q6qjp9o,"Namibia's proposals to lift the ban on the international trade in black and white rhino horns have been rejected at a key conservation meeting. The result of the voting at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) earlier this week was adopted by the conference on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Namibia had also proposed overturning the ban on African savanna elephant ivory - this too was defeated. Eyebrows were raised about the rhino horn trade proposals mainly because Namibia pioneered the practice of cutting the horns off rhinos in 1989 so they no longer have value for poachers. Dehorning was followed by other southern African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa. Rhino horns are prized in traditional Asian medicine and are also status symbols in China, Vietnam, and some other south-east Asian countries. Namibia tabled two separate proposals - one for black rhinos and the other for southern white rhino. Both were resoundingly defeated, with only around 30 votes out of about 120 in favour. Cites regulations require a two-thirds majority for a proposal to be adopted. Black rhinos are listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2023, there were only 6,421 alive - a decline of more than 90% since 1960, according to an IUCN report. The southern white rhinos are not in quite such danger - they are listed as near threatened, with a population of  15,752. But this is down 11% since 2023 and at its lowest point since the current rhino poaching crisis began nearly two decades ago. Cites banned the trade in the horns and other rhino parts in 1977 but their poaching continued with more than 8,000 lost in the last decade, according to Save the Rhino International. In Namibia, the number of rhinos poached was the highest on record in 2022, with 87 killed - almost twice as many as the year before, government data shows. Although this was the first time that Namibia tabled the two proposals seeking the lifting of the ban on the rhino horn trade, the country has backed similar proposals by other southern African countries including South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe in the past. Experts say the main reason these countries want the ban to be lifted is because of the huge stockpiles of rhino horns they have amassed over the years. ""Namibia and other pro-trade rhino range states have amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn they wish to trade,"" Taylor Tench, senior wildlife policy analyst with the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the BBC. ""Namibia's stockpiles are an estimated 6.45 tonnes of white rhino horn and an estimated 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horn. South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much."" The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme. The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed. The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless. But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly. As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating. ""The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,"" said Mr Tench. ""Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised."" The governments of both countries have been approached for comment. Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts. Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures. But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching. They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues. Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN. South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said."
China US,How the US overtook China as Africa's biggest foreign investor,2025-11-10T00:17:37.214Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yl88wd3lo,"You probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working. But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been the in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa, The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead. This American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. ""The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,"" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. ""This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market."" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. ""We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity"". Sepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. ""To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,"" she says. ""So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants."" Ms Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. ""There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,"" she says. ""You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc."" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative. One US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa is in South Africa's Gauteng province. ""It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,"" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa. However, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick. He argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough. ""Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,"" says Prof Branstetter. Going forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haihambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."
China US,China launches new aircraft carrier in naval race with the US,2025-11-07T08:00:25.247Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e0yx39g5o,"China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third aircraft carrier, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds. Its entry into active duty marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships. China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up. The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong. State media hailed the Fujian as a ""major milestone"" in the development of China's navy. The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian. The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea. State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: ""Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!"""
China US,Devastating toxic spill seen as test of whether African countries will stand up to China,2025-12-02T06:02:35.007Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6nly288j4o,"Even before the dam collapsed, Lamec did not feel safe working at the copper mine. ""If our work protective gear gets damaged, it is not always replaced,"" he tells us. ""We have to take a risk and use it again."" He is talking to the BBC in a car on a quiet backroad near a village in northern Zambia, too nervous to speak to us in public or to use his real name, for fear that speaking to the press might cost him his livelihood. When he turned up for his shift one day in February, he tells us, he found that one of the dams at the Chinese-owned mine had been closed. The tailings dam - used to store toxic by-products from the copper mining process, including heavy metals like arsenic, mercury and lead - had collapsed into a tributary connected to the Kafue, Zambia's longest river and a major drinking water source. At least 50,000 tonnes of acidic debris spilled out into the surrounding waterways and farmland, according to the government. Some environmentalists, however, claim as much as 1.5 million tonnes was spilled, with one expert saying a full clean-up could take longer than a decade. The spill has killed the fish around the towns of Chambishi and Kitwe, made the water undrinkable and destroyed crops, farmers have told the BBC. There are fears that, now the rainy season has started, heavy metals still sitting in the mud will further infiltrate the land and waterways, causing a second wave of pollution. Toxic metals that can cause kidney damage and cancers, as well as gastric and intestinal issues, could be carried downstream to the capital, Lusaka, says Dr Mweene Himwiinga, a senior lecturer at Zambia's Copperbelt University. The Chinese embassy in Lusaka disputes the scale of the damage and told the BBC it welcomed the establishment of an independent investigation into the incident. The Zambian government, it said, had reported that the pollution was contained to a confined area, water acidity levels had returned to normal limits and that ongoing checks showed no lasting public-health risks. Lamec, like his country Zambia, finds himself in a difficult position. The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse. More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment. In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households. They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement. The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories. ""All eyes are on this case,"" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. ""Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved."" People found it hard to believe at first ""because something of this scale had not happened before,"" he adds. The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining. Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China. But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba. ""There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,"" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. ""We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue."" Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese. Between 2000 and 2023, 49 African countries are believed to have signed $182.3bn (£139.4bn) worth of loans with Chinese lenders. In Copperbelt Province, Lamec tells us he was really broken by the spill affecting his family. ""We were told that the waterways now had acid in them, and that we were not supposed to use the water."" For two weeks after the spill, Lamec says he and his family weren't allowed to use the local water until it had been sprayed with lime to help reduce the acidity. He took the job at the dam because, he says, he has no other way to make a living, but now feels conflicted about working there. Copper mining has been the economic backbone of this region for more than a century. The metal makes up 70% of Zambia's exports and accounts for 15% of its GDP. The industry is set to grow further, with plans to more than triple production in Zambia by 2031, according to plans laid out by the government last year. In the village of Twalima, it has been a struggle to grow anything since the spill, say farmers Abigail Namtowe, 28, and Frederick Bwalya, 72. Farming was the main source of food and income for Ms Namtowe's family, and her six year-old daughter is now very hungry and malnourished, she told us. ""I've tried to grow my maize, I've tried everything so the hunger won't kill my child, but it's too much."" Mr Bwalya has lived in Twalima for 33 years. Strong and energetic, we meet him working on his farm which he tends to daily. ""Farming is not going well because the soil is not clean,"" he says. He also describes a severe pain in his leg which won't go away and makes it difficult for him to move. ""The doctor says the contaminated water could be causing this,"" he adds. Sino Metals has promised to build a borehole away from the contaminated stream at the bottom of his farm, he says, but that hasn't happened yet. He believes that water deeper underground would be safer. The stream used to be teeming with fish, say Mr Bwalya and his neighbours, adding that since the spill, there haven't been any. The BBC asked Sino Metals about the alleged promise to build boreholes on the land of affected farmers. We also put Lamec's allegations that he does not feel safe working at the company, but the firm did not respond. Fifty kilometres (31 miles) away from Frederick Bwalya's village, in Kamwatimpa, we saw schoolchildren swimming in a tributary of the Kafue river. Some mothers - still worried about the pollution - said they had told their children not to go into the water. But the government says it sampled 21 sites across Copperbelt Province in September, and that the concentrations of heavy metals were within national safe limits. Now the rainy season has taken hold, the power to stop a second wave of pollution seeping into the soil, and carrying heavy metals down the river to the rest of the country, is in the hands of the government and Sino Metals. The clean-up has been delayed by issues between the consultants hired to assess the damage and Sino Metals, Dr Chibamba told the BBC, when asked why some of this work hadn't been done earlier. Meanwhile, Dr Himwiinga warns that failure to deal with the situation ""may be catastrophic"". ""They [the heavy metals] could be there for years, and their effects could be felt for a very long period of time, by farmers... who rely on that water to irrigate their crops,"" she says. ""According to research carried out by Copperbelt University, this could go on for even over 10 years, unless remediation efforts are put in place."" The Zambian government says it is aware of this and has instructed Sino Metals to put mitigations in place to stop secondary pollution - including planting trees, to bring down levels of pollution in the air and soil, as well as spreading lime to reduce acidity. These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities. Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment. Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company. One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments. But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries. ""The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,"" says Prof Chan. ""The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans."" Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa. African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says. ""It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world."" African governments are ""not always getting it right"", he says, however ""this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make."" For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was ""grossly unfair"" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial. ""Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,"" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says. ""It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa."""
China US,Louvre to hike ticket prices for most non-EU tourists by 45%,2025-11-28T08:59:32.121Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyd4llgrego,"Ticket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday. From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery. The museum's security and management have faced criticism since , when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes. An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure. From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum. Non-EU visitors in groups with accredited guides will also have to pay €28 starting next year, the Louvre told the BBC. The price hike is expected to raise between €15m and €20m each year to support the museum's modernisation plans, it added. The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum. There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026. Macron also said the to deal with overcrowding. Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo. The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros. Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics . The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration."
China US,Shein and Temu face calls for investigation over claims of stealing US designs,2025-12-02T09:52:28.694Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lvzeyk21vo,"Online retailers Shein and Temu are facing increased pressure in the US after two senior politicians pushed for investigations, including into claims of forced labour and intellectual property (IP) theft. In Texas, the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a probe into allegations of forced labour and the use of unsafe materials at Shein. At a national level, Senator Tom Cotton called for a federal investigation into possible IP theft at both Shein and Temu, which he labelled ""Communist Chinese"" platforms. Shein said it took concerns raised about its business practices seriously. Temu did not immediately respond for comment. Shein said in a statement that it would co-operate with the investigation and that it welcomed ""constructive engagement"" with Paxton. It said in response to Cotton's letter that the company continues to invest in protecting the rights of designers worldwide. ""We are constantly improving our internal processes to better protect creators,"" said Shein. The retailer is headquartered in Singapore but most of the goods sold on its platform are made in China, where it was founded. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, Cotton - senior Republican from Arkansas - said that millions of packages from China now sit in US warehouses after Washington changed its rules on low-cost shipments in August. , a global tariff exemption widely used by buyers of low-cost goods. The change subjected shipments to levies and stricter customs checks. The new regulations gives the Department of Justice and Homeland Security a ""golden opportunity"" to act, said Cotton, a key ally of Trump and a vocal critic of China. Designers and small American brands have accused Shein of systematically copying their original creations, often just days after launch, and selling them at a fraction of the price, he said. Cotton also accused Temu of carrying ""sophisticated and deceptive fakes"" on its platform, which has hundreds of millions of users. Cotton cited a which found a significant proportion of items that its researchers bought on Shein and Temu were likely counterfeits. Separately, Paxton from Texas said that numerous reports have raised serious concerns about Shein's alleged reliance on forced labour, and claims of the use of unsafe materials and deceptive marketing. The brand has been under scrutiny over the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business and the on its site. The Republican lawyer said the investigation will assess if Shein's practices violate Texas law by allegedly using hazardous materials and if it has misled consumers about ethical sourcing. The probe will also examine Shein's data collection practices, he added. ""I will not allow cheap, dangerous, foreign goods to flood America and jeopardise our health,"" said Paxton online. Shein also faces calls by the European Union to curb sales of childlike sex dolls and weapons on its third-party marketplace place after . Temu is also being investigated in France over the spread of harmful content accessible to young people. Shein is not the only firm under fire by Paxton, who, like Cotton, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. He and deceiving parents about the dangers that the platform is said to pose to young gamers. Roblox has denied the claims, which it said are based on ""misrepresentations"" of its online gaming platform."
China US,Aardman to celebrate 50 'cracking' years in home city,2025-12-02T15:54:45.446Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv34344y4o,"The animation studio behind Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run and Shaun the Sheep is celebrating 50 years in the business with a major new exhibition in its home city. Bristol-based Aardman Studios, famed for its stop-motion and clay modelling animation, was founded by school friends David Sproxton and Peter Lord. The ""Cracking Exhibition Gromit: 50 Years of Aardman in Bristol"" is due to take over the M Shed next summer, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, iconic characters and a celebration of the studio's ""deep-rooted connection"" to the city Ngaio Harding-Hill, from Aardman, said: ""2026 is such an important year for Aardman and the anniversary would never have been complete without a celebration in our home city."" ""The programme of experiences with M Shed and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery will be a real highlight celebrating the importance of Bristol, its people and creative connection to the studio over the last 50 years,"" he added. As part of the collaboration, ""Aardman treasures"" will also be hidden throughout Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. Bristol Museums head of culture, Philip Walker, said they were ""absolutely delighted"" to be working with Aardman on this exciting collaboration. ""It's a brilliant celebration of Bristol's creative spirit and a tribute to the imagination and humour that Aardman has shared with the world for half a century,"" he said. ""We can't wait to showcase 50 years of clay, creativity, and cracking adventures."" The first Wallace And Gromit film was 1989's A Grand Day Out, which was followed by The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit and A Matter Of Loaf And Death. The studio's most recent film Vengeance Most Fowl, which saw the return of evil penguin Feathers McGraw, picked up two gongs at the Baftas awards ceremony and was also nominated for an Oscar."
China US,'I am devastated': Hong Kong residents in disbelief after fire destroys blocks of flats,2025-11-27T15:03:14.208Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjnlx1g6yo,"""When you get closer the heat rises and you can feel it and the smoke is really heavy."" Student Thomas Liu was one of many people drawn to the scene of a deadly fire that tore through much of the eight-block Wang Fuk Court housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district. At least 83 people have died so far in the devastating blaze that began on Wednesday, and with hundreds still missing, this number is expected to rise. The cause is not yet known, but three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to flammable materials, including mesh and plastic sheets, that may have allowed the fire to spread quickly. ""It's a disaster,"" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. ""Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,"" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. The fire was gradually being contained but officials said they did not know when it would be fully extinguished. Flames could be seen coming from individual apartments as many people watched on in silence. One woman said her friends live inside the building and she was waiting to hear if they managed to get out. Harry Cheung, who has lived in block two of the Wang Fuk Court complex for more than 40 years, told Reuters he heard ""a very loud noise"" and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. ""I immediately went back to pack up my things,"" the 66-year-old resident said. ""I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight because I probably won't be able to go back home."" A woman in her sixties, whose surname is Kam and who lives in the adjacent Kwong Fuk Estate, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that several of her friends living in Wang Fuk Court had been accounted for - but not all. One friend has daily afternoon naps and may have been sleeping when the fire broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT), Ms Kam said, adding that the woman's daughters have not yet been able to contact her. Another resident, 65-year-old Jason Kong, told Reuters that a neighbour called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. ""I am devastated. There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do. I hope the government can help us to settle down after this."" An elderly woman who lives in one of the affected blocks told the BBC she was not at home when the fire broke out but that she was worried about her apartment because it was not insured. ""I'm very upset that I have no home to go to now,"" she said. While the cause of the fire that engulfed the multiple high-rise blocks was unknown, police say a mesh material and plastic sheets were found outside the buildings - both of which are not believed to be fireproof. Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows. These materials may have caused the fire to spread more quickly, said police. Some people have expressed anger that such a massive fire could have happened and criticised the response. ""When there's a wildfire, they will deploy helicopters and drop water bombs, but why is there no such deployment and how can they leave other buildings burning?"" Ms Poon, another resident of Wang Fuk Court, who is in her sixties, asked. ""The community is so close to the fire station and we thought the fire could be put out soon, but now the fire has spread. I'm so disappointed,"" she told the SCMP. Ms Poon noted that she had been given no instructions from the government on where to seek help. The BBC spoke to some Tai Po residents who had brought supplies to the victims and affected residents - including dozens of blankets and heat packs. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said government departments were assisting residents affected by the fire. When asked about their feelings about the fire, the residents said ""the government is incompetent"" and that they were ""immensely heartbroken"". ""We don't want to see any more casualties,"" said one."
China US,COP30: Five key takeaways from a deeply divisive climate summit ,2025-11-23T00:10:18.355Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp84m16mdm1o,"In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive. Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated. The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change. Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the ""COP of truth"". The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted. And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting. Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible. So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP. The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations. Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that. While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return. Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas. To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion. It made matters worse. Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy. The EU were given short shrift by major producers. ""We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,"" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer. Ouch! Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse. Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP. These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain. They are the richest group of nations still in the but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour. While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of. The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft. The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the ""tripling"" word stayed in the text. So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in. ""Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,"" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics. ""This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union."" The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front. The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself. Two often heard positions: How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words? How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks? The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore. ""We can't discard it entirely,"" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News. ""But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far."" Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people. It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore. Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an ""implementation cop"" and put a lot of focus on the ""energy agenda"". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant. COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance. For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an ""orchestrated"" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G. 'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking. The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it. They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - ""unilateral"" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive. The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad. If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves. Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials. The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization. The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways. US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here. Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals. And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels. ""China kept a low political profile,"" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society. ""And they focussed on making money in the real world."" ""Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position."" to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

China US,Sixth-tier club contemplates second doc series,2025-11-23T12:32:40.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx5j096pxo,"A sixth-tier football club's owner says he is ""very close now to agreeing on series two"" of a documentary about his Sussex team. Eastbourne Borough Football Club has released the seven-episode Owning Eastbourne series on its YouTube channel. Cameras followed the club through the 2024-25 season, when the team lost in the National League South play-off semi-finals to Maidstone United. The club's owner Simon Leslie claims the first series of the documentary has ""had some really good interest"" from broadcasters since its release. It was broadcast on ReachTV, a channel shown in US airports, and the club is close to a deal to show the programme in China, according to Mr Leslie. The club owner told the BBC the documentary ""gives us an opportunity to share with people who want to get involved in what we're doing"". ""It's a very expensive business owning a football club,"" he said. ""I've had very broad shoulders for nearly three years and I need people to come in and support me, and help me, and be part of this journey."" He said viewers get ""a full, unfiltered view of behind the scenes, in the changing room, in the boardroom of what it's like in non-league football"". ""What's been really great over the last couple days is some of the comments have been incredibly positive,"" Mr Leslie said. ""There have been some less so comments as well, but it is like nothing else."" So far this season, Eastbourne have struggled in the National League South and currently find themselves in the relegation zone. Matt Gray, who was appointed in the summer, was sacked by the club in October and replaced by Tommy Widdrington for his second spell as manager of the club. Mr Leslie said the season so far had been ""a rollercoaster arc of emotions"" but he felt the team was ""on the up""."
China US,Dutch government suspends intervention into chipmaker Nexperia,2025-11-19T15:53:52.309Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7p7j83rn1o,"The Dutch government has suspended its intervention at Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, following talks with China. The Hague over ""serious governance shortcomings"" and concerns over the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods. In response, Beijing blocked exports of the firm's chips. However, on Wednesday the Dutch government said it would halt its original decision following ""constructive talks"" with Beijing. China said it welcomed the move, adding it was a ""first step in the right direction towards a proper resolution"". Nexperia is a major supplier of basic computer chips to the car industry, and shortages have threatened global supply chains. A shortage of computer chips used in various electronic goods and cars would hugely impact the ability of manufacturers to make their products. The decision by the Dutch government will ease tensions between the European Union and China, which have been mounting in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. Vincent Karremans, economic affairs minister, said that he considered it right to suspend action, made under the Goods Availability Act, ahead of further talks with the Chinese government. ""We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement. The Dutch government said it originally invoked the Act following concerns ""from actions attributed to the now-suspended CEO, involving the improper transfer of product assets, funds, technology, and knowledge to a foreign entity"". ""These actions ran counter to the interests of the company, its shareholders, and Dutch and European strategic autonomy and security of supply,"" it said. In October, a Dutch court ordered the removal of ex-Nexperia CEO and Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng, citing alleged mismanagement. The Dutch government added that its decision had aimed to prevent a situation in which chips could become unavailable in an emergency. In December last year, the US government placed Wingtech, which owns Nexperia, on its so-called ""entity list"", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. Following the Dutch government's reversal, the Beijing acknowledged the move but said it was ""still a step away from addressing the root cause of the global semiconductor supply chain turmoil and chaos"". ""Furthermore, the erroneous ruling by the corporate court, spearheaded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, to strip Wingtech of its control over Nexperia remains a key obstacle to resolving the issue,"" it added. Wingtech has said it will fight the decision. Following the latest move, a spokesperson for Wingtch said the company ""strongly"" rejected the allegations against its chief executive. ""To date, no proof has been provided,"" it added. ""If the Dutch government is sincere about solving the problem, the Ministry should now file a letter with the Enterprise Chamber, explicitly withdrawing its support for the proceedings. ""These proceedings form a threat to the continuity of Nexperia B.V. and therefore for the economic security of the Netherlands and Europe - which is the exact same argument the Dutch government made previously in support of judicial intervention."""
China US,What we know about the Hong Kong apartment fires,2025-11-28T09:47:59.280Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxe9r7wjgro,"Hong Kong's deadliest fire in more than 60 years ripped through a high-rise public housing complex in the city's north-east this week, killing at least 128 people. Dozens more remain missing, with 79 people confirmed injured and and 89 bodies yet to be identified. Now, as the last flames are extinguished and the high-rise blocks smoulder against the city's urban skyline, attention has turned to the cause of the deadly fire, and the factors that allowed it to so rapidly spread. Many Hong Kongers have described it as a ""man-made disaster"". Authorities have attributed the ferocity of the blaze to Styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks - while also noting that fire alarms in all eight housing blocks were found to be not working effectively. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire, according to local media reports, and an investigation has been launched. What initially caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far. The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT). Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, each 31 storeys high. Seven have been affected by the fire, Tai Po district councillor Mui Siu-fung told BBC Chinese. Built in 1983, the tower blocks were undergoing renovations when the fire broke out. Tai Po is a residential district in the northern part of Hong Kong, near the city of Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland. The complex provides 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of the people who lived in the Wang Fuk Court housing complex are at least 65, or older, according to the latest census. Some of them have lived in the subsidised public housing estate since it was built. The cause of the fire is unknown, but Hong Kong Security Chief Tang Ping-Keung on Friday attributed its rapid spread to styrofoam placed outside the windows of the apartment blocks. A preliminary investigation previously found that the blaze had escalated unusually fast, and police had revealed that a mesh material and plastic sheets - both of which are believed to not be fireproof - was found on the outside of the buildings. Police have arrested three men aged between 52 and 68 on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the deadly blaze. Two of them are directors of a construction firm while the other is an engineering consultant. A police spokesperson on Thursday said investigators were looking into the alleged actions, or failure to act, of the firm's top officials. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" said the spokesperson. Authorities on Friday further noted that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working effectively - confirming prior reports from some residents who said they did not sound when the blaze broke out. This was Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years. Within 40 minutes of first being reported it was declared a level four alarm - but it was raised to a level five, the highest in severity, about three and a half hours later. Local media had earlier reported that explosions could be heard inside the building and fire hoses could not easily reach the higher levels. The ferocity of the heat had prevented firefighters from entering the buildings. Officials told reporters on Friday that even after the fire had been put out, some sections of the buildings' remained above 200C (392F). The city's fire department on Thursday said that the combination of high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments made rescue operations difficult Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have an average living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out. Hundreds were evacuated to temporary shelters, and some were allocated emergency housing units. More than 2,311 firefighters took part in rescue operations, with 12 sustaining injuries during the response. Authorities said 391 fire engines were also mobilised and 188 ambulances dispatched. Among the dead is firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, who was with the service at Sha Tin Fire Station for nine years. The fire service says it lost contact with him at 15:30 local time, and about half an hour later, found that he had collapsed. He was taken to hospital but declared dead shortly after. ""I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,"" said Andy Yeung, director of the fire service. One resident, Mr Chung, told the BBC he got a panicked phone call on Wednesday afternoon from his wife saying she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Mr Chung said he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. to accommodate residents who were evacuated, the government said. The South China Morning Post reported that one of them - at Tung Cheong Street Sports Centre - was full, and residents were being directed to other shelters. Another, the Kwong Fuk Community Hall, which is just over the road from the housing estate, was deemed unsafe. Evacuees were moved to another shelter, further away. BBC Chinese reporter Gemini Cheng saw elderly residents, some using walking sticks or wheelchairs, arriving at some of the shelters. At least 900 people are taking shelter in such temporary facilities, news agency AFP reports, quoting Lee. Six schools in Tai Po will remain closed on Thursday, the Education Bureau announced, . An emergency monitoring and support centre is in operation to manage the impact of the fire, security secretary Tang Ping-keung said in a statement. A hotline for the public to ask about casualties has been set up by Hong Kong police. The tower blocks at Wang Fuk Court are covered in bamboo scaffolding and green construction netting, right up to the rooftops, because they are undergoing renovations. As mentioned earlier, authorities have attributed the quick spread of the fire to materials used in the renovation, such as mesh netting, plastic sheeting and styrofoam. It's still unclear how the fire began, but no matter its cause, proper netting on the buildings' exterior would have been key to preventing its spread, Jason Poon, chairman of construction NGO Chinat Monitor, told news outlet Initium Media. Substandard netting could cause the fire to spread rapidly, he added. Another engineer told Initium Media he believes that the vast majority of mesh netting used in construction across Hong Kong is not made of fire-retardant material. Cardboard, debris and paint thinner is also often found on the scaffolding, which along with dry weather could hasten the spread of fire, the engineer said. One fire safety expert the BBC spoke to said the bamboo scaffolding - a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. Authorities have not mentioned scaffolding as having caused or fuelled the rapid spread of the fire. Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong, although reports said these were caused by falls and other safety failures, rather than fires. Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were ""relatively old"" - they were built in the 1980s - so ""the glass windows are not that fire resilient"". ""The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane... [which makes it] very easy to be broken by the flames and the flames can then penetrate through the facade."""
China US,Strange pillar of light linked to Chinese rocket,2025-12-06T12:02:15.539Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98ze8jx7o,"A glowing streak spotted in the sky on Thursday morning was most likely caused by a Chinese rocket, experts say. Witnesses reported a bright, linear trail visible around dawn and dusk from several locations. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the US, said: ""It was definitely the Chinese Zhuque-3 rocket making its first test flight. ""It passed over the UK and northern Europe at around 05:00 GMT at the end of its first orbit, following launch from China at 04:02 GMT. Chinese upper stages have been previously observed to make long, linear propellant-dump trails."" Ellie Jarvis, from Clovelly, said: ""I've never seen anything like it. At first, I wondered whether it might be something like an aurora or a natural phenomenon - like a light pillar. ""I tried to see whether there was something shining a beam of light from across the bay, or perhaps from a ship - but that didn't  seem likely as the light seemed to be so high in the sky."" A jet contrail was also considered but dismissed because the trail appeared too widespread. Similar vertical light effects, known as light pillars, can sometimes form when high-altitude ice crystals reflect low-angle sunlight, creating unusual atmospheric displays."
China US,Cats became our companions much later than you think,2025-11-27T20:02:21.954Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8dvdp9gn7o,"In true feline style, cats took their time in deciding when and where to forge bonds with humans. According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place. A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. ""They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,"" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford. ""That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago."" All modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat. How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists. To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats. The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa. ""Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,"" said Prof Larson. This fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies. Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought. They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China. Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica. And in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene. These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years. The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially ""commensal"" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. ""Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,"" she said. Leopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia. Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s. The research is published in the journal, and in ."
China US,'Hang in there': Agonising wait for the missing after Hong Kong blaze,2025-11-28T07:11:58.245Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9y0pjzmdro,"""Hang in there."" Those were the last words Mr Chung said to his wife after a huge 's Tai Po district. It was around 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday when he got her panicked phone call. She said she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat. He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it. Firefighters in the Chinese territory took nearly 24 hours to tame the blaze that tore through seven tower blocks, including theirs, claiming at least 128 lives so far. Nearly 300 people are still unaccounted for - Mr Chung's wife is among the many missing. The BBC spoke to several residents who were not at home or managed to escape in time. Some, like Mr Chung, have waited outside the burning buildings, hoping against hope. There was no alarm warning them of danger, all of them told the BBC. Mr Chung, 45, and his brother, spent Wednesday night on the street asking the firefighters dozens of times for updates - but they couldn't give them any. Throughout, he said, he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. ""She probably did faint,"" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. ""I dare not call her again."" Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. ""She passed away with our cat, who she loves,"" he said, breaking down in tears. His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. The Chungs moved in a decade ago to Wang Cheong House – the first of the seven tower blocks at Tai Po to go up in flames. When the fire started, Mr Chung says, the smoke on the 23rd floor, where they lived, turned so thick within just 10 minutes, that his wife couldn't find her way out. The cause of the fire is still unclear, but authorities believe renovations using flammable material and scaffolding helped spread what has now become the deadliest blaze in Hong Kong in six decades. It engulfed seven of the eight buildings - comprising 1,800 units - in Wang Fuk Court, a subsidised housing estate built in 1983 to the north of Hong Kong Island, where the city's wealthy live. Nearly 40% of Wang Fuk Court's residents are aged 65 or above, according to the 2021 census. It's partly why it's feared so many residents were trapped - because they are older and less likely to have made it out quickly. Ms Fung, 40, has not been able to find her mother yet. She and her parents moved to the estate only last year - for its views of the ocean. Her father and she were at work when the fire started. Ms Fung received a call from her neighbour, who said she was hiding with Ms Fung's mother inside a toilet. But they lost contact at midnight on Wednesday. All the same, she is holding on to hope: ""We will think about our next steps after my mum comes out."" She sought help from police, but she says she was furious when they called her back to ask if it was possible her mother could have somehow escaped. She demanded to know how that was possible: ""You know much better than us how badly burnt Wang Cheong House is!"" On social media, posts about missing elderly relatives, children and pets have been circulating endlessly. A desperate mother wrote: ""I still can't find my baby girl. It's nearly 30 hours and there has been no updates from the fire service…"" In a later post, she said: ""I am afraid there is no hope."" The devastation has spotlighted the expensive and controversial renovations at Wang Fuk Court, which cost about HK$330M ($42.2M; £32.1M), with each household having to pay between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000. Many residents had opposed the project because of the costs but it went ahead. Authorities have now arrested three executives from the construction firm, citing ""gross negligence"".  Police say the mesh and plastic sheets used on the scaffolding were substandard, and that windows were wrapped in highly flammable styrofoam. Grandma Chan, a long-time resident, says she had been scared since the renovation began last year, because of its scale and she had occasionally noticed a burning smell. ""Will anything happen if I stay home?"" she once asked her daughter. The 72-year-old was alone at home when the fire started but she only found out about it when her daughter, who was travelling in South Korea, called. She says she made it out alive because her daughter told her to flee. It was the same for 82-year-old Grandma Wu. When the fire broke out, she was playing mahjong, a popular game, with her neighbours. They were warned not by an alarm, but by their husbands calling them. But she said they continued the game because there were three buildings between theirs and Wang Cheong House, where the fire broke out. Then came a second call, saying the fire had reached their building. The women immediately took the lift and reached the ground floor. Surrounded by the smell of burning buildings, Grandma Wu looked up to find that seven of eight buildings within the complex were in flames. Although she was safe, she stayed outside, with her helper, overnight. She says her son wanted to take her to his home but she refused. ""I have been living in this flat for 42 years,"" she says. ""I told my son not to come, and I would not go anywhere. I have to sit here and watch how this goes. My heart will only be at peace after the fire is extinguished."" When that happens, a new battle begins for many residents who have poured a life's worth of savings into buying these homes. Kyle Ho, 32, moved into the complex with his retired parents three years ago. Despite the subsidised price, they needed a mortgage to afford a home at Wang Fuk Court. Now, they don't know what comes next. The Hong Kong government has announced cash relief of HK$10,000 for displaced families, and a HK$300m assistance fund. That could be some relief for Mr Ho. ""The worst-case scenario is that we have lost our flat,"" he says. ""But the most important thing is that all of us are safe. We are luckier than many other families."" For those like Mr Chung, the wait continues as authorities insist they have not ruled out rescuing people. ""We haven't given up,"" they said earlier on Thursday. Mr Chung, too, is determined to find his wife. ""I want to rescue her - whether she's alive or gone."""
China US,"Graduate jobs under threat from AI, PwC boss says",2025-11-21T02:34:57.601Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm272510e6jo,"The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) may eventually lead to fewer entry-level graduates being hired, the boss of accountancy giant PwC has told the BBC. However, global chairman Mohamed Kande said AI was not behind recent job cuts at the firm, adding that the company actually needed to hire hundreds of new AI engineers but was struggling to find them. But some observers say the technology itself threatens thousands of junior jobs across the professional services industry. Speaking on the sidelines of a business summit in Singapore, Mr Kande also said big changes in the global economy, such as US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, had been good for the firm's consulting business. He also addressed the company's suspension in China last year over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande, promising that the same mistakes ""would not happen again"". Headquartered in London, PwC is one of the Big Four accountancy firms. It provides a range of services, such as financial auditing, consulting and tax advice for business clients around the world. According to Mr Kande, advising them on how to integrate AI into their operations will be at the heart of the firm's future business strategy, even as the rapidly advancing technology affects its own hiring plans. Firms who would have previously hired PwC consultants to sift through data and documents may now use AI models instead, turning weeks of costly work into mere minutes. Every year, the company hires thousands of new graduates in entry-level positions - including 1,300 in the UK and 3,200 in the US last year - but it recently dropped long-term plans to continue increasing its headcount. In 2021, PwC said it wanted to hire 100,000 people over the course of five years - but Mr Kande said this would no longer be possible. ""When we made the plans to hire that many people, the world looked very, very different,"" he said. ""Now we have artificial intelligence. We want to hire, but I don't know if it's going to be the same level of people that we hire - it will be a different set of people."" Last year, PwC cut more than 5,600 roles across its worldwide operation. The boss of the company's UK business has previously spoken about reducing graduate recruitment, admitting that AI was ""certainly reshaping roles"". At a global level, however, Mr Kande insisted that the AI boom was an ""exciting time"" for creating new jobs. ""We are looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers today to help us drive our AI agenda, but we just cannot find them,"" he said. Businesses around the world may be facing challenges adapting to AI, but in the meantime PwC appears to have benefited from the broader uncertainty in the global economy, largely fuelled by President Trump's extensive use of tariffs. ""We are receiving a lot of calls from many companies around the world asking how to navigate the current environment,"" said Mr Kande. ""It's been good for us. We need to remain relevant to our clients and we have to be in these discussions, which we are."" However, the company took a huge reputational blow last year, when over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande. The firm went bust after amassing debts of more than $300bn (£230bn) and has been at the centre of a ruinous housing crisis that continues to damage lives and livelihoods in China. The country's Securities Regulatory Commission found that PwC, as the auditor, had ""covered up and even condoned"" financial fraud at Evergrande. Mr Kande, whose tenure as global chairman began after Evergrande went bankrupt, said PwC no longer faced any restrictions in China. ""Let me tell you - we changed many of our people, implemented new quality management systems and introduced new governance systems,"" he said. ""My focus has been to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."""
China US,Meta accused of letting AI sellers 'run rampant',2025-11-29T07:01:17.149Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz90d4q0o,"Facebook owner Meta has been accused of allowing misleading companies to ""run rampant"" on its platforms, as dozens of people say they have fallen victim to sellers using AI-generated adverts. More than 60 people contacted the BBC after we revealed unscrupulous foreign firms were . Some said they had been targeted by ads on Facebook and Instagram, and consumer guide Which? said businesses were using the platforms to ""spread their lies furthest and widest"". Meta said it had removed content by six companies, flagged by the BBC, which claimed to be based in England but were shipping cheap goods in from Asia. The tech giant said it did not allow fraudulent activity and worked closely with Stop Scams UK to protect users. One company removed from the platform is C'est La Vie, but had a returns address in China. Mabel & Daisy, which used AI generated pictures of a mother and daughter and claimed to sell ""timeless clothing"" from a shop in Bristol, has also been removed from the platform after it was exposed for selling cheap items from a base in Hong Kong. Other companies Meta says it is taking action against are clothing firms Sylvia & Grace, Chester & Claire, Harrison & Hayes and Olyndra London, as well as accessories business Omelia & Oliver Jewels. All have one-star reviews on Trustpilot with hundreds of customers saying they were duped into thinking they were buying from UK-based brands and received shoddy goods. Harrison & Hayes claimed to be a Manchester-based independent clothes shop with ""decades of experience"" but has a returns address to a central warehouse in China. It has used an AI-image of a shop front in the city which does not exist. Chester & Clare also uses an AI-generated image of a shopfront to market its business, which it claims has operated in London since 2005 but is actually based in the Netherlands and sells clothes shipped from China. Its terms of service states imagery, stories, characters and boutique locations ""may have been created using generate AI"" to ""enhance customer experience"". The BBC contacted all businesses but only got automated responses. Claire Brown was persuaded to buy two dresses for £73 from Luxe and Luna London, after ""constantly"" seeing the company's appealing adverts on Facebook. When the dresses arrived weeks later they were poorly made of flimsy material and ""looked awful"". ""It felt like a trusted brand after I'd seen it on Facebook so much, you see all these clothing collections and I liked what I saw,"" she said. Ms Brown, who works in tech marketing, said she reported the company to Meta but never got a response. The company has now stopped operating, with stating life had ""taken a devastating turn"" because of the death of a partner, an almost identical statement used by fake Birmingham jewellery business C'est La Vie. ""It makes me feel really cross, because I hate people being scammed and the websites are the kind of thing you would share with a friend,"" Claire added. ""There is a real lack of protection here for consumers."" Another Facebook user, Stuart, said he had reported a number of suspicious companies to the platform but was advised to ""influence the ads that you see by hiding ads and changing your ad preferences"" in its response. No other action was taken. Some of the fraudulent companies discovered by the BBC appear to be . That's where a third-party buys products from a wholesaler and sells them with a significant mark-up, having never seen the product themselves. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) recently that used images of roses, cobbled streets and the union jack when it was shipping goods from a warehouse in Asia. The regulator said it was continuing to take action on misleading adverts but said platforms like Facebook played an ""important role"" in maintaining ""responsible advertising"" and continued to engage with them on how best to prevent those that break the rules. Which? said Meta had allowed fake companies to ""run rampant on its platforms for too long"" and said it should be doing ""much more"" to stop scams and protect its users. Meta said it wanted users to report suspicious adverts on its platforms, which was an ""important signal"" to its review systems and could prompt a re-review of the advert while improving policies."
China US,Mum and baby fire plea sent to woman in Manchester,2025-11-28T19:08:29.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0nld5v87zo,"A woman in Manchester said she received pleas for help from a mum who was stuck in a Hong Kong flat fire with her newborn baby. At least after the and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. The cause of the fire remains unclear though officials said that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread. Cherry moved to Manchester three years ago but she grew up in the complex and is still on a residents' group chat where she saw the pleas for help. Cherry said she did not sleep on Wednesday night. ""I felt really really sad because I knew I couldn't do anything,"" she said. ""I was seeing messages from people still in the fire asking for help, pleading to be saved. ""What I most strongly remember was a mother - she was in the fire with her three-month-old baby, messaging for help. She told us the address and said 'please help to save us'. ""A lot of people downstairs were writing support to her, telling her how to keep stable and calm until the firemen came."" Cherry told Radio Manchester that the mother and baby were rescued and were safe and well. ""They are in hospital for monitoring,"" she said. But Cherry said they were not the only residents who were trapped like this. Cherry said she believed ongoing maintenance work, flammable materials and a lack of working fire alarms were responsible for the scale of the tragedy. ""There is green mesh outside the building because of the maintenance work,"" she said. ""However in Hong Kong there is no understanding that this mesh needed to be fire resistant. ""The residents say they have tested the mesh nets and found out that the material was not fire resistant and they are angry. ""They are thinking about how they pay so much money but didn't get what they needed, didn't get anything to protect their lives."" Authorities are investigating the incident. ""It is too late now,"" said Cherry. ""I think what we should be doing is looking at how to prevent this happening again for a second time,"" she added. on suspicion of corruption over the renovation work at the complex. Three others were also detained earlier on manslaughter charges."
China US,"Britain won't beat the US in AI race, says ex-Google scientist",2025-11-24T06:43:20.856Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e7mj0jmro,"A computer scientist who revolutionised the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has called for the UK to be ""brave"" in its pursuit of the technology. Llion Jones, who was part of the pioneering Google team that unlocked AI's ability to respond in a human-like form, warned against trying to compete with ""hyper-scalers"" in the United States and China. He said the ""sycophantic"" responses of the current wave of AI chatbots needed to be fixed. ""We need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you,"" he said. Mr Jones, who was raised in Bangor and Abergynolwyn in Gwynedd, north Wales, is one of the co-authors of , which introduced the Transformer architecture that put the ""T"" in ChatGPT. It was a breakthrough that now underpins the generative AI systems that are transforming business and everyday life. Still based in Tokyo, he is now the chief technology officer of Sakana AI, the firm he founded with another former Google researcher. His company focuses on speculative research into future uses of AI, something he claimed was ""unique"", as other big tech firms were focused on monetising the current wave of large language models. ""I do genuinely think that we are unique in that respect right now,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I'm trying to make the environment to give people the freedom to do the research they want, and I'm going to try and protect it as long as I can."" Mr Jones said governments in Cardiff and Westminster needed to accept the reality of a global race which was being won by America and China, and focus instead on different types of AI developments. ""I think a country like Wales, or even Britain in general, is not going to beat the hyper-scalers, right? They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs. ""It doesn't make any sense to be a part of that race, because you're not going to win. ""So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave."" He argued that ""something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research"". ""It's a bit of a longer bet, but if it pays off then you're back in the race, right?"" While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations. Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology. ""AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,"" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle. Some of the businesses at the event ""are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,"" he added. ""If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,"" Kyle said. He added that a 1% increase in small business productivity would generate £240bn worth of economic activity. AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to ""drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive"". It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology. Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government. But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales. There have been to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas. ""Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,"" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons. Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands. ""What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,"" he said. ""There's so much more benefit that comes from the modernisation of grid infrastructure. ""When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible."" Mr George warned Wales could ""lose out"" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions. Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant ""the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly"". While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots. ""They've become very sycophantic,"" he said. The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them. ""Unfortunately, humans love being told that they're right. ""This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.' ""So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you."""
China US,Trump's plan for Gaza backed by UN Security Council,2025-11-18T02:03:30.771Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpkgq4wllo,"The UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza. Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained. Adopting it was an ""important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire"", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan ""imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject"". ""Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,"" it added. Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas. Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be ""tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians"". The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force. Trump called the Security Council vote ""historic"" and said it was a way of ""acknowledging and endorsing"" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. ""This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for. Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text. The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to ""translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground"" and lead to ""a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution"". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution. The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented ""urgently and immediately"". Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it. Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution. The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a ""fragile, fragile first step"". Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack. More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
China US,'My heart breaks every time I'm called a hero' - Hong Kong fire survivor,2025-12-03T23:13:49.458Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2054rdv52o,"William Li has struggled with the label ""hero"" since helping his neighbours escape the fire which engulfed the Hong Kong block of flats he had called home since birth. Instead, he is haunted by guilt that he could have saved more people from the blaze at Wang Fuk Court, which left at least 159 people dead. ""My heart breaks every time someone calls me a hero,"" says the 40-year-old, breaking down in tears. A week on from the disaster, firefighters are still combing the complex of seven burnt-out high rises for the remains of 30 of Mr Li's neighbours - people who, like him, had the misfortune to be at home when the deadly fire began. What caused the fire to start, and why more people did not escape, is now the subject of an independent committee's investigation, ordered by Hong Kong's chief executive. Already, it has been revealed that non-fire resistant netting had been fitted around the building, and the fire alarms were not working properly. The fact alarms did not go off was the reason why Mr Li was not more worried when his wife called to tell him a fire had started in their building, Wang Cheong House. Instead of rushing, he spent almost 10 minutes packing belongings. But the moment he opened the door, the extent of the disaster was all too clear: he was engulfed in billowing smoke and had to retreat inside his flat. On the other end of the phone, his wife became hysterical, but Mr Li didn't have time to panic. He had to put wet towels under the door to stop the smoke from getting in, and tried to work out what to do next. It was then he heard voices in the corridor, where the air was now so dense with smoke he was unable to see who was calling out. Covering his face with a wet towel, he found two of his neighbours by touch, dragging the couple inside to the relative safety of his flat. In a neighbouring block, Bai Shui Lin was also trying to help her neighbours. The 66-year-old is thought to have saved at least three families, banging on their doors to warn them of the fire. Mrs Bai did not survive, however. Her sons identified her body at the weekend. ""If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,"" Yip Ka-Kui told the BBC's US partner, CBS. ""But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others."" Back in Mr Li's flat, the middle aged couple revealed they had heard another voice in the corridor: a domestic worker calling for an elderly woman. But now, the voice had gone quiet. This time, Mr Li was unable to help. ""I feel very guilty,"" he said. ""Some people weren't saved and I didn't open my door again and try to find them."" Mr Li does not know yet what happened to the voice in the corridor. Nine Indonesian and one Filipino domestic workers are reportedly among the dead, but others survived - including Rhodora Alcaraz, 28, who was trapped in another flat looking after her employer's three-month-old baby and elderly mother. She too has been hailed a hero for staying by their side. All three were rescued by firefighters eventually - but not before Ms Alcaraz had sent a series of voice messages to her sister. ""I'm feeling very weak. I can't breathe,"" she said in one of the clips, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Li and the couple - named in local media as the Chows - realised they too needed to escape. Several hours had elapsed, and their options were running out. One fire exit was blocked by the flames, while Mr Li's neighbour believed the other was locked. They decided not to jump out of the second floor window due to the intensity of the fire, and the constant explosions. A subsidiary of Danish company ISS, the property manager of Wang Fuk Court, has not responded to a BBC inquiry over reports that the emergency exit was locked. ""It was the first time I felt death had something to do with me,"" says Mr Li. That's why he started saying goodbye to friends one by one via WhatsApp: ""I can't escape,"" he told them. ""If something happens to me take care of my children. Look after yourselves."" About two and a half hours after the blaze began, firefighters finally reached them on an aerial ladder. Mrs Chow told HK01, a Hong Kong-based news outlet, that Mr Li insisted the firefighters should get them out first. ""We are older and told him he should leave first. He refused and said he was young and could handle this."" When the firefighters came back for him, Mr Li felt reluctant to leave his home, which was filled with fond memories and treasured collections of photography equipment and toys. ""The fire was telling me that I couldn't take anything away, that I had no right or power to stop it from devouring everything."" Mr Li reunited with his family at a nearby fast food restaurant. But after he'd reached hospital it took until the early hours of the morning for the true extent of the horror he'd endured to make itself felt. ""I no longer had any strength in me and when I got to the emergency room, my knees gave in. A burning smell lingered in my nose,"" he says. ""I really wanted to wash away the smell."" After being admitted to a ward at 03:00, Mr Li finally had the space to cry and start trying to process the ordeal he had gone through. ""When I had been to hospital before, I wanted to go home as soon as possible,"" he says. ""But this time when the nurse asked me [if I wanted to go home], I wasn't willing to leave. I felt like I was avoiding what I would have to face in the future."" He has however decided to face the trauma upfront – by doing as many interviews as he can. ""I hope many people will come forward to help find the truth,"" he says. ""I hope Wang Fuk Court residents will be given answers and justice."""
China US,Gardeners unearth stolen phones left by snatchers,2025-11-25T06:00:33.440Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vm6p3vjd2o,"Volunteers at a community garden in central London have been reuniting phone theft victims with their stolen devices after finding them buried in flower-beds. The Phoenix Garden, off Shaftesbury Avenue in Covent Garden, has seen snatchers stash stolen phones in its grounds due to its proximity to the West End, in an issue first reported by . Garden volunteers said they collected the phones from bushes and flower-beds and handed them to their owners or the police. As a result, fewer devices have been unearthed in recent weeks. Louise Gates, Phoenix Garden manager, said she often found phones ""thrown over the fence from the night before"" when she unlocked the garden in the morning. ""Some of our volunteers have dug up phones wrapped in tin foil,"" Ms Gates added. Tinfoil is often used by phone snatchers to stop the device's location being detected. It is believed that snatchers, often on electric bikes around hotspot areas like Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, have been temporarily stashing the phones in the garden for collection at a later date. Ms Gates said some of the theft victims had arrived at the garden after tracking their device's signal through Apple's Find My app. Ms Gates said if she could find the emergency contact information on the phone, she called the number provided. ""They're all really so grateful, which is nice,"" she said. ""Other times I charge it up, but nobody rings, I don't know who it belongs to or I can't find them on social media, so I just take it to the police station."" Ron Chenery, a volunteer of two years, said finding phones was a regular occurrence. ""Most of us love the garden so much, we're constantly out in the fresh air. If we see something we hand it in,"" he said. Community worker Elliot Hughes, who helps local students access the garden and get into nature, said it was important to teach young people about the wider risks of phone theft across the capital. ""The best we can do is give awareness"" he said. ""There's young people now, walking around central London on their phones, in the middle of the street, which are essentially £1,000 computers. ""So [I am] just highlighting to them maybe the things they shouldn't be doing."" A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said local officers had stepped up patrols in the area to identify potential phone snatching offenders. ""By intensifying our efforts we're catching more perpetrators and protecting people from having their phone stolen in the capital and have reduced theft by 16% since April. ""We're also dismantling organised crime groups suspected of large-scale phone theft."" The force called on phone companies including Apple and Samsung for security improvements that would make stolen phones harder to sell."
China US,Putin says Russia ready to supply 'uninterrupted' fuel to India ,2025-12-05T12:50:31.387Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g482m3yyzo,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to provide ""uninterrupted shipments"" of fuel to India, as Delhi faces pressure from the US to stop buying Russian oil. Putin, speaking alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, questioned earlier why India should be punished for buying oil when the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Moscow. President Donald Trump has imposed , arguing that Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil helped fund the war in Ukraine - an accusation India denies. Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a ""peaceful solution"" to ending the war - warning that Ukraine must withdraw from the Donbas ""Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,"" he said. Modi repeated India's stance that it was not neutral on the war in Ukraine and stood on ""the side of peace"", welcoming efforts to find a ""lasting"" solution to end the war. He highlighted that increasing the ""connectivity"" of Russia and India was a ""major priority"" for India. In recent months, India-US ties have hit an as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. Trump initially imposed a 25% tariff on India, but announced an additional 25% later as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"" at the time. In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US. ""The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?,"" he asked. Russia remained the US' top supplier of nuclear reactor fuel last year, - citing data from the Department of Energy. A ban on enriched uranium imports from the country was enshrined into law in May. The two leaders exchanged memorandums during Friday's briefing, outlining mutual objectives in areas including trade and agriculture. Modi announced two new 30-day visa schemes for Russian tourists visiting India, and said that two new Indian consulates had opened in Russia. Russia Today, a Kremlin-funded, state-controlled TV network, would also be launched in India, the prime minister said. No major defence deals were announced, but the two men said there were agreements signed on shipbuilding, investments in civil nuclear energy and critical minerals. India and Russia also agreed on an economic programme valid until 2030, the leaders said, spanning jobs, shipping and the health industry. Putin said he was confident about increasing current bilateral trade from $60bn to $100bn in the coming years. Modi said that ""energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership"", but made no specific reference to oil. India - the world's third largest consumer of crude oil - has been buying large volumes from Russia since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But some Indian firms have already started reducing oil imports from Russia to comply with US sanctions. Putin also referenced a ""flagship project"": building India's largest nuclear power plant, that he said Moscow would help with. In a joint statement released after their meeting, the leaders said their partnership was being ""reoriented toward joint research and development, as well as the production of advanced defence platforms"". Putin added that he and Modi were cooperating on foreign policy, with their coalition of Brics countries promoting a ""more just"" and ""multi-polar"" world. Brics is an informal alliance of several major developing countries - including India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa - which formed in 2006, broadly to challenge the political and economic power of North America and Western European nations."
China US,Zambian-American influencer sentenced to 18 months for hate speech,2025-12-02T14:58:51.583Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqnklqge7o,"A Zambian-American influencer and political vlogger has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech for making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema. Zambian-born Ethel Chisono Edwards, who also holds US citizenship and works as an estate agent in New York, has a large following across various social media accounts. Known as ""One Boss Lady"", she has become renowned for her rants about the president over the last two years. The 42-year-old was arrested at Zambia's main airport three months ago after arriving to attend her grandmother's funeral. She pleaded guilty in a magistrate's court in the capital, Lusaka, and apologised to the president for her comments. But Magistrate Webster Milumbe said the court had a duty to send a strong warning, noting that hate speech had become increasingly common. Edwards, who has been in police custody since her arrest, was convicted under the Cyber Security Act and the Cyber Crimes Act - new legislation that came into effect this year. She admitted to using a computer system to publish the offensive statements, acknowledged having no lawful excuse and conceded that her words were motivated by hatred. Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, described Edwards as a remorseful first offender with potential. He went on to detail how she was a breadwinner and philanthropist who sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment. He also delivered a detailed public apology on her behalf. ""I want to unreservedly apologise to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large,"" it said. Throughout her court appearances, Edwards appeared subdued - a stark contrast to her online persona. The magistrate acknowledged Mr Katati's plea for mitigation and said Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest. Mr Katati said he had not yet received instructions from his client on whether to appeal against the sentence. The jailing of the influencer has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others arguing that it violates freedom of speech. Hichilema, who came to office in 2021, has abolished criminal defamation laws against the president, but Zambians still face prosecution under other laws. In September, two men were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to use witchcraft to kill President Hichilema."
China US,Namibia loses bid to overturn ban on rhino horn trade,2025-12-05T14:24:32.464Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30j7q6qjp9o,"Namibia's proposals to lift the ban on the international trade in black and white rhino horns have been rejected at a key conservation meeting. The result of the voting at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) earlier this week was adopted by the conference on Thursday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Namibia had also proposed overturning the ban on African savanna elephant ivory - this too was defeated. Eyebrows were raised about the rhino horn trade proposals mainly because Namibia pioneered the practice of cutting the horns off rhinos in 1989 so they no longer have value for poachers. Dehorning was followed by other southern African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa. Rhino horns are prized in traditional Asian medicine and are also status symbols in China, Vietnam, and some other south-east Asian countries. Namibia tabled two separate proposals - one for black rhinos and the other for southern white rhino. Both were resoundingly defeated, with only around 30 votes out of about 120 in favour. Cites regulations require a two-thirds majority for a proposal to be adopted. Black rhinos are listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2023, there were only 6,421 alive - a decline of more than 90% since 1960, according to an IUCN report. The southern white rhinos are not in quite such danger - they are listed as near threatened, with a population of  15,752. But this is down 11% since 2023 and at its lowest point since the current rhino poaching crisis began nearly two decades ago. Cites banned the trade in the horns and other rhino parts in 1977 but their poaching continued with more than 8,000 lost in the last decade, according to Save the Rhino International. In Namibia, the number of rhinos poached was the highest on record in 2022, with 87 killed - almost twice as many as the year before, government data shows. Although this was the first time that Namibia tabled the two proposals seeking the lifting of the ban on the rhino horn trade, the country has backed similar proposals by other southern African countries including South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe in the past. Experts say the main reason these countries want the ban to be lifted is because of the huge stockpiles of rhino horns they have amassed over the years. ""Namibia and other pro-trade rhino range states have amassed large stockpiles of rhino horn they wish to trade,"" Taylor Tench, senior wildlife policy analyst with the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the BBC. ""Namibia's stockpiles are an estimated 6.45 tonnes of white rhino horn and an estimated 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horn. South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much."" The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme. The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed. The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless. But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly. As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating. ""The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,"" said Mr Tench. ""Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised."" The governments of both countries have been approached for comment. Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts. Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures. But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching. They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues. Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN. South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said."

China US,Thailand extradites owner of Myanmar scam city to China,2025-11-12T07:02:44.288Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20xx2pl69o,"She Zhijiang, a Chinese national accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, is being extradited to China - ending his years-long battle against the order. He has been detained in Thailand since 2022, after the Thai police arrested him acting on a Chinese request to Interpol. China accuses She Zhijiang of running illegal online gambling rings, and this week a Thai court upheld the decision to extradite him.  He arrived at a Bangkok airport on Wednesday, flanked by two security officials. His extradition comes ahead of a landmark visit by Thailand's king to Beijing - the first state visit to China by a reigning Thai monarch and a sign of deepening ties. She Zhijiang is one of the biggest names linked to the vast cyberscam hubs in South East Asia, which have trapped thousands of Chinese nationals and sparked a crackdown from Beijing. One of his most notorious projects is Myanmar's Shwe Kokko city, near the Thai border. It's portrayed in promotional videos as a resort city for Chinese tourists, but its glitzy buildings are allegedly home to fraud, money laundering and human trafficking. During a , the BBC saw very few overseas visitors. Local people there said that scam businesses were still operating. She Zhijiang and his company Yatai is sanctioned by the UK and the US for his links to rights abuses in the scam farms in their development. Speaking to the BBC from prison earlier this year, She Zhijiang maintained that his company would ""never accept telecom fraud and scams"" - though he also noted admitted that scammers were likely to enter Shwe Kokko since the city was ""completely open to anyone"". Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, She Zhijiang left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China. In 2014 a Chinese court convicted him of running an illegal lottery. But over the years he expanded his gambling business to Cambodia and other countries in the region. He also holds Cambodian and Myanmar citizenship, according to the US Treasury. The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in scam centres concentrated in South East Asia. They are often lured there by fake job offers and held against their will, forced to defraud others online or face brutal punishment. Many of them are Chinese nationals - a source of concern for Beijing. China has been ramping up crackdowns on such scam operations. In recent months it has ."
China US,Reform or rights rollback? India's sweeping labour law overhaul sparks debate,2025-11-28T00:00:09.578Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwk28d5yzxo,"Last week, India announced it would implement what many say are its most far-reaching economic reforms in decades - compressing 29 federal laws that regulated labour into . As a result, the number of rules that govern labour have now come down from a staggering 1,400 to around 350, while the number of forms companies had to fill in this regard have reduced from 180 to 73 - drastically lightening the regulatory burden on businesses. The laws got a parliamentary nod in 2020 but are finally set to be uniformly implemented across the country after a five-year delay and much political wrangling. Companies - which have long blamed restrictive labour practices for the atrophy in India's manufacturing sector - have given the changes a rousing welcome. ""This is part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of Trump's 50% tariffs, and an important signal that it is keen to ease doing business in India, attract more FDI [foreign direct investment] and integrate into GVCs [global value chains],"" said Nomura, a broking house. But trade unions are asking for their withdrawal and calling the codes the most ""sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers' hard-won rights and entitlements since [India's] independence"". The changes have triggered demonstrations across the country, with 200-300 people turning up at a protest in capital Delhi on Wednesday, led largely by left-leaning trade unions not aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. At the protest site, Akashdeep Singh, a 33-year-old factory worker employed at an international beverage company on the outskirts of Delhi, told the BBC that ""the laws will benefit only the employers and not workers like us"". Several others expressed similar anxieties. The government says the long-pending reforms aim to modernise outdated laws, simplify compliance, and protect workers' rights - while giving legal recognition to India's growing gig workforce for the first time. Several worker-friendly measures - mandatory appointment letters, uniform minimum wages, free annual health check-ups for those over 40, and gender-neutral pay - are welcome steps. Coupled with fewer compliance burdens, stronger social security, and an expanded definition of employees to include gig workers, these reforms could help formalise India's vast informal economy, experts say. The new codes also iron out glaring inconsistencies, such as varied definitions of the same rules that were prevalent in the previous laws, according to Arvind Panagariya, economist at Columbia University and former chairman of the Indian government's think tank Niti Aayog. ""You could not implement 100% of the Indian labour laws without violating 20% of them,"" Prof Panagariya in the Times of India newspaper. But even with the many welcome provisions, two contentious clauses in the reforms have particularly irked unions. These include rules that will make it easier for companies to fire workers and also harder for workers to legally conduct strikes. Earlier, factories with 100 or more workers needed the government's permission before they could lay off employees. Now, that threshold has been increased to 300. ""Why is the government trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce from the labour legislation?"" Sudeep Dutta, national secretary of CITU (Centre for Indian Trade Unions), told the BBC. ""Pending grievance cases for labourers are already in millions. Cases are not being registered… workers are not able to lodge their complaints and now the government is bringing in a labour code which is trying to exclude a huge section of the workforce,"" he added. Mr Dutta also said the new rules which ask workers to give a 14-day notice before going on strike - earlier applicable only to state-run companies - are further snatching away workers' powers to collectively bargain. Economists like Prof Panagariya argue that the old rules barring layoffs in firms with 100 or more workers were ""draconian,"" hampering India's competitiveness compared to countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China. He writes that a flexible labour market is key for India to attract entrepreneurs, as China did decades ago, to bring capital, technology, and global links - catalysts for economic transformation. Nomura economists agree, saying that the increase in worker threshold limit for retrenchment/closure ""should encourage firms to build larger scale factories, boosting the manufacturing sector, and expanding employment opportunities over time"". But economists like Prof Arun Kumar argue that labour restrictions alone do not explain India's weak competitiveness or the slow private-sector investment in new factories. ""Inadequate private investment is not due to these laws but due to inadequate demand, as wages [in India] are low, so mass demand remains low,"" Prof Kumar told the BBC. ""The new labour code will not have any impact on these aspects."" He warns against weakening workers' bargaining power, especially as technology displaces jobs and unemployment remains high. ""It is an issue of retaining the few rights that existed under the old system even though it was highly flawed,"" said Prof Kumar. While ideological differences remain, experts broadly agree that the outdated and complex codes - often used by inspectors to harass factory owners - needed simplification. With over half of India's working-age population out of the labour force and nearly 60% of workers self-employed, it's clear the old rules were failing. The impact of the new rules on India's manufacturing growth and investment remains uncertain, but in the short term, the transition will pose challenges for companies. ""Organisations will need to prepare for changes to wage structures, HR systems, social security provisioning and compliance governance,"" according to staffing agency BDO India. Since labour is regulated by both state and central rules, employers may face dual compliance for a while, says BDO India, even as the government deals with ongoing resistance from unions."
China US,"Australia at risk of 'high-impact sabotage' from China, says spy chief",2025-11-12T03:27:44.652Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n43emvejo,"Australia's spy chief says hackers linked to the Chinese government and military are targeting the country's critical infrastructure, warning the country was increasingly at risk of ""high-impact sabotage"". Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), said ""unprecedented levels of espionage"" meant a growing threat of ""cyber-enabled sabotage"" in the next five years. He singled out ""one nation state - no prizes for guessing which one - conducting multiple attempts to scan and penetrate critical infrastructure in Australia"" and its allies, ""targeting water, transport, telecommunications, and energy networks"". The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment. Authoritarian regimes were now more willing to ""disrupt and destroy,"" Burgess warned. He cited two Chinese hacking groups, Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, and Australia. ""These groups are hackers working for Chinese government intelligence and their military,"" he told business leaders at a forum in Melbourne on Wednesday. ""Both groups were involved in the theft of sensitive information, but the real danger was the threat of sabotage - disruption to critical infrastructure."" He said Salt Typhoon's intent was espionage, breaking into telecommunication networks in the US. ""And they have been probing our telecommunication networks here in Australia too,"" Burgess said. He said Volt Typhoon's actions were intended to be disruptive, with hackers compromising critical infrastructure networks in the US for potential, future sabotage. ""And yes, we have seen Chinese hackers probing our critical infrastructure as well,"" Burgess said. He warned that authoritarian regimes are increasingly willing to sabotage critical infrastructure in order to ""impede decision-making, damage the economy, undermine war-fighting capability and sow social discord"". ""I do not think we - and I mean all of us - truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,"" he said. Burgess pointed out that , unrelated to foreign interference, have had significant and widespread impacts on society. ""That's one phone network not working for less than one day,"" he said. ""Imagine the implications if a nation-state took down all the networks? Or turned off the power during a heatwave? Or polluted our drinking water? Or crippled our financial system?"" Spies are increasingly ""broadening their collection requirements"", Burgess said. ""They are aggressively targeting private sector projects, negotiations and investments that might give foreign companies a commercial advantage. And like criminals, they have been aggressively targeting customer data."" The spy chief said conservative estimates showed that espionage cost Australia A$12.5bn ($8.2bn; £6.2bn) in 2023-24, with about $2bn worth of trade secrets and intellectual property stolen from Australian companies in one year. Burgess described the hackers' abilities as ""highly sophisticated, using top-notch tradecraft to find your networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks"". ""And when they have penetrated your networks, they actively and aggressively map your systems, and seek to maintain persistent undetected access that enables them to conduct sabotage at a time and moment of their choosing."""
China US,India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at COP30 climate summit,2025-11-21T01:17:06.411Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8v8k8mlego,"At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter. India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being ""worryingly inadequate"". Delhi has argued otherwise. Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming. So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change. The that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement. But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies. UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets. The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it. All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap. But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem. Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December. So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30? Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world. A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that ""global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone"". ""For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,"" he wrote. While , Yadav seemed to expand on this argument. ""Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,"" he said. Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries. The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue. The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn. Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans. Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot. ""The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,"" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30. Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states. India says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline. Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges. Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as "" "". It has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C. Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal. In the , published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU. ""India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,"" a report by the think-tank noted. According to the recent , India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia. But the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan. And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels. It remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends."

ArcelorMittal Kent Wire, the largest steel manufacturer in Europe, began the process last week ahead of pulling out of the site on Pier Road. The company was among the opponents to now-approved plans to redevelop the docks, claiming they would be forced out of the location should they proceed. A spokesperson from ArcelorMittal Kent Wire said: ""We have informed all employees of the decision to enter a consultation process, with all jobs at the site at risk due to the severity and scale of the challenges facing the business."" The firm has faced difficulties, such as low demand, competition from China, and US tariffs, according to the . Peel Waters, which owns the site, had an application to approved by Medway Council in May 2024. An unsuccessful request to made by then-MP for Rochester and Strood Kelly Tolhurst, meant the Basin 3 proposal was not officially approved until November 2024. The application remains subject to a judicial review, which was heard at the High Court on October 29 and 30. A ruling has not yet been made. ArcelorMittal Kent Wire was one of the businesses opposed to the plan, as was the Save Chatham Docks campaign group. Peel Waters also wants to build a 950-home development on the site, which would include a supermarket and a pub. Ms Tolhurst, who campaigned to save the jobs, said she was ""absolutely devastated for the people at the docks"". ""For some people, it will be life-changing. It's not a booming jobs market at the moment, so for those people it's going to be a really frightening time right on top of Christmas,"" she said. A spokesperson for Peel Waters said: ""For over 10 years, we have tried to work with ArcelorMittal Kent Wire and other tenants to explore relocation solutions, including suggesting suitable local port locations that could meet their operational needs... ""Subject to the outcome of the ongoing judicial review, we remain committed to delivering Basin 3."""
China US,Charity shop finds sold for thousands at auction,2025-11-15T07:26:26.854Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1xqd9j1o,"Two pieces of Chinese porcelain discovered in charity shops have sold for thousands of pounds at auction. The items were taken to Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, whose chairman and Asian art specialist, John Axford, identified them as Chinese works from the 19th Century. A ""five dragon"" dish, which was due to be sold at a Dorset charity shop for £2, went under the hammer for £7,620 and a blue and white ""dragon"" bottle vase sold for £5,080. ""These discoveries highlight the extraordinary treasures that can still be found in the most unexpected places,"" said Mr Axford. An astute manager at the charity shop in Blandford Forum thought it was worth getting the dish valued. Mr Axford said he ""immediately recognised"" the period of the piece, due to its distinctive blue and yellow decoration. Further findings, such as the six-character Emperor Daoguang mark of the period (1821-1850) also confirmed its link to the Chinese Imperial Collection. The proceeds will go directly to the charity of the shop where it was discovered. ""These do not come onto the market very often; they're usually held in public collections or sometimes in private collections and this one has been languishing about somewhere in the south west of England,"" said Mr Axford. ""A lot of quite important Chinese imperial porcelains were brought back to Europe following the fall of the Qing dynasty. ""Almost all of the interest in the sale was from mainland China and Hong Kong,"" he said. The blue and white bottle vase was spotted by an eagle-eyed shopper in a charity shop in Surrey, for which she paid £100. Impressed by its craftsmanship, she brought the piece to Mr Axford, who confirmed that it dated from the first half of the 19th Century. ""Not only are these items culturally and historically significant but in the case of the dish, the sale will directly benefit a good cause,"" he added."
China US,Tesla looks to reset strategy amid sluggish India sales,2025-11-27T07:40:11.867Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrn00pn1m7o,"Tesla has opened its largest sales and service hub in India even as the EV giant struggles with weak sales in Asia's third-largest economy. The centre in the northern city of Gurugram combines an experience showroom, charging, and after-sales services under one roof. The EV maker has sold just over 100 cars in India since its much publicised debut in July this year, dealership data shows. Sources close to the company told the BBC that Tesla is now focusing on strengthening India's EV ecosystem in a bid to revive sales momentum. Tesla didn't directly respond to BBC queries on the low sales figures. The Elon Musk owned EV maker has been struggling to get a foothold in India since its launch in July, receiving bookings for barely over 600 cars till mid-September, according to . Dealership data accessed by the BBC shows only a small portion of these bookings  converted into sales since deliveries started in September, even as competitor models in the premium category, from brands like BMW, BYD and Mercedes Benz reported robust sales aided by festive demand and tax cuts. The EV maker's plan to improve sales is said to include a three-pronged strategy to increase adoption, install more charging stations across the country and boost customer experience. High taxes and slow adoption remain major barriers to EV growth in India, experts say. For Tesla, the steep upfront price of its cars is another challenge. But speaking at the Tesla Centre launch in Gurugram, India head Sharad Agarwal said buyers can recoup up to two million rupees ($22,400; £16,900) over four years on fuel and maintenance - a third of the price of its Model Y sold here. ""Most of the [maintenance] service is done remotely through software updates, which reduces cost of ownership. And cost of home charging is one tenth of petrol prices,""Mr Agarwal said. ""Their [sales] numbers are low by any standard,"" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India told the BBC. ""But I think that's strategic. They have just put their foot in the door in India. And they have good potential to increase sales here in the time to come."" EVs make up less than 3% of passenger vehicle sales in India, and charging infrastructure has been slow to develop -  the country has only Tesla's cars can be charged at home, adding up to 44 miles (70.8km) of range per hour. The company is also expanding its network, including superchargers that can deliver about 170 miles in 15 minutes. Tesla's weak India sales come amid a broader slowdown in demand across its biggest markets -  Europe, China and the US. The company's profits fell in October despite record quarterly revenue, boosted by a last-minute rush from US buyers to claim an expiring tax credit. The firm said revenue for the three months to the end of September hit a record $28bn (£21bn), up 12% from the same time last year. But the company's profits dropped by 37% for the same period, partly due to extra costs linked to tariffs and research and development. In India, Musk has shown in local manufacturing, opting for an import-led strategy despite incentives announced in March last year to attract global EV makers."
China US,"They can't crush our protests, vow Georgians after year of resistance",2025-11-27T00:03:12.454Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c208w378gg7o,"""I'm standing for the future of this country,"" says Giorgi Arabuli, who has taken part in protests on the streets of Georgia's capital Tbilisi almost every night since they began a year ago. Mass demonstrations were met with violent police crackdowns as tens of thousands of Georgians turned out, angered by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's decision on 28 November 2024 to call a four-year halt on moves towards joining the EU. ""I'm from the generation of the 1990s. I've seen those dark times after the civil war,"" said Giorgi. ""Most of it was caused by Russian influence in a post-Soviet country. We don't want to go back there."" Since then Georgians have seen a ""dismantling of democracy"", , and it has prompted accusations of Russian-style rule. On the streets, the protests have evolved into a grinding war of attrition. For months, Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue was blocked for a few hours every evening. New laws and a heavy police presence forced the protesters to adapt, marching through adjacent streets and facing nightly arrests. The Georgian Dream government has imposed massive fines for blocking roads, slapped criminal charges on young protesters and most recently pushed through a law allowing up to 14 days' imprisonment for a first offence of blocking traffic, with repeat offenders facing up to a year in jail. ""Freedom for regime prisoners,"" reads a large banner carried towards the nearby Supreme Court. ""They've used every method to crush the protests... but the fact is they haven't been able to,"" says Nata Koridze. Her husband, Zura Japaridze, is one of six key opposition figures jailed after refusing to testify before a parliamentary commission into alleged crimes by the previous government. The six were jailed for up to eight months and banned from holding public office for two years. Prosecutors have since announced new charges against eight opposition leaders, including Japaridze. They now face up to 15 years for alleged sabotage and aiding foreign powers. Nata Koridze's husband is due to be released on 22 December but she says he is due to appear in court again three days later. They are accused of communicating with Western partners about government abuses - standard democratic practice - as evidence of betraying state interests. Japaridze, like all the jailed politicians, is held in solitary confinement. ""Zura has not seen anybody except for a doctor and the guard,"" she says. Georgia's path to EU membership, once the cornerstone of its post-Soviet identity, is now farther away than ever. Earlier this month, the EU's annual enlargement report delivered what , concluding it was now considered an EU candidate ""in name only"". ""Georgia is not on the trajectory to become an EU member state, neither in 2030 nor later,"" said Pawel Herczynski, rejecting the government's pledge to ensure membership by 2030. The BBC approached the head of the parliamentary committee on European integration and other Georgian Dream MPs for comment, but no-one was available. The government's public response has been increasingly hostile towards its foreign critics. Parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili has accused the EU of ""ideological and political dictates"", telling pro-government TV this month that ""today's Brussels does not want a Georgia that is like us"". ""They want a country standing on one foot,"" he complained. ""The policies and approaches in Brussels must be changed. For them, the Georgian people and their choice mean nothing, zero."" Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, won 54% of the vote in last year's disputed parliamentary elections, which monitors from Europe's OSCE security mission said were marked by several shortcomings, including intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, especially public sector employees. All opposition parties have since boycotted parliament leaving it entirely in government hands. That means increasingly repressive legislation has been passed unopposed. As well as steep fines for protesters blocking the road, there have been a restrictive broadcasting law and a law on foreign grants requiring all foreign funding for civil society and media to be approved by a government commission. Hundreds of protesters have been fined and dozens jailed, among them well-known actor Andro Chichinadze, given two years for allegedly organising protests. His theatre - once the best attended in Tbilisi - has closed in solidarity. The belief that Georgia's government is acting in Russia's interest is widespread among pro-Europeans here. They point to the ruling party's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s; legislation mirroring Russian laws targeting civil society; the government's refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine and increasingly hostile anti-Western rhetoric. Georgia's leaders reject that portrayal, describing their approach towards Russia as ""pragmatic"" and their primary duty to maintain peace with their northern neighbour. ""Where are the facts?"" said Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, denying pro-Russian bias during a recent TV interview. The government, he said, was being ""responsible to Georgian society which wants to keep peace in the country"". That is not the view of one of Georgia's most respected journalists, Mzia Amaglobeli, imprisoned for two years for slapping a police officer. ""Russia is conquering us without war. An oligarch is ruling our country, depriving us of a European future and legitimising autocratic, dictatorial rule. We need the support of the democratic world,"" she told the BBC in a handwritten letter from prison. for Freedom of Thought next month, says she has lost the sight of one eye and her remaining vision is worsening in solitary confinement: ""I have difficulty reading for even 10-15 minutes at a time."" Georgia's democratic decline intensified even before last year's elections, with a June 2024 Russian-style law on foreign influence that targeted civil society and independent media. Students played a big part in protests at the time and the government has responded with sweeping education reforms planned next February. Georgia's 19 state universities will be required to concentrate on a single academic discipline under the slogan ""one city, one faculty"". The reforms will tackle perceived problems including excessive concentration of universities in Tbilisi, duplication of programmes and inadequate state funding. The prime minister argues that funding should be ""focused on fulfilling state tasks"". Leading figures at Georgia's pre-eminent research institution, Ilia State University, say the reform is more about imposing political control and eradicating free space. ""After political parties, media and NGOs, universities must be put under pressure,"" says Nina Doborjginidze, rector of Ilia State University. ""If students are removed from the capital, they're removed from the political scene."" ""This is not about education quality, it's a political project,"" adds vice-rector Georgi Gvalia. ""This is an abrupt change in Georgia's foreign policy from being one of the most pro-European countries in the region to the most difficult partners of the West, and change towards more autocratic great powers, like Russia and especially China."" Georgia and China now have a strategic partnership and Beijing has invested heavily in Georgian infrastructure. Back on Rustaveli Avenue, teacher Rusudan Lomidze, who has attended the protests every day, says Georgia's fate is inextricably linked to Ukraine's. ""If Ukraine is forced to sign a capitulation agreement, it will be an absolute disaster for us. Our boys are fighting in Ukraine, and they are fighting for both Ukraine and Georgia."" More than 110 Georgian volunteers have been killed fighting for Ukraine, both Georgian citizens and ethnic Georgians, and the Georgian Legion is the biggest contingent of foreign fighters there. The crowds in Tbilisi are smaller than they were a year ago, but several hundred protesters still gather every night despite the risks. Reflecting on her years as a diplomat working towards EU and Nato integration, Nata Koridze now believes ""all of that has crumbled"". ""But the protest embodies an idea. And ideas live through decades, through centuries."""
China US,Two popular gay dating platforms removed from Apple app store in China,2025-11-12T02:55:23.056Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98n2kye01eo,"Apple has confirmed that it has removed two of China's most popular gay dating apps  - Blued and Finka - from its app store in the country following an order from authorities. ""We follow the laws of the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,"" an Apple spokesperson said. The move has raised concerns amongst the LGBT community in the country. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy in Washington and the companies behind both apps for comment. A ""lite"" version of the Blued app remains available on Chinese app stores, according to checks by the BBC. Some other gay and bisexual dating apps are also still available in the country, like Jicco and Jack'd. Blued is one of the most widely-used gay dating apps in China, with tens of millions of downloads. Apple runs a separate app store in China, in accordance with the country's strict internet laws. Popular apps like Instagram and WhatsApp are not available in China. Android device users there use locally adapted versions of the operating system as the Google Play Store is also blocked in China. Members of the LGBT community expressed concerns about the removal of Blued and Finka, with one saying, ""I hope those heterosexual policymakers can understand that love is rare - it's not something shameful or unspeakable."" In 2022, popular US-based gay dating app Grindr was removed from Apple's App Store in China shortly after the Cyberspace Administration of China began a crackdown on content it viewed as illegal and inappropriate. The following year, the Chinese government announced new rules requiring all apps serving domestic users to register for licenses, resulting in a slew of foreign apps being removed online. The online regulator said the rules were designed to ""promote the standardised and healthy development of the internet industry."" Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, though same-sex marriages remain unrecognised. Advocacy groups, including the Beijing LGBT Center and the ShanghaiPride, have ceased operations in China in recent years."
China US,Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash,2025-11-11T15:44:10.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko,"A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales  told Qian Zhimin she was ""the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed"". After fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures. More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. Investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul. ""If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,"" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. ""Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost."" Qian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after . She moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend. So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property. As Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could ""get rich while lying down"". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping. But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke. Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022. In the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth. Police raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history. Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices. But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme. ""The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,"" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC. One of her investo s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day. ""That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,"" he says. He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more. In addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them. ""There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment."" Investors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found. A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends. Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: ""We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance."" The company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready. Lantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly. ""Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,"" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. ""They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world."" A range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said. ""We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?"" The company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to. ""That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,"" Mr Yu says. Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog. But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li. ""Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,"" he remembers. ""We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth. ""She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations."" Mr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them. A Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme. ""The payouts suddenly stopped,"" Mr Yu recalls. ""The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough."" What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police. What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money. Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project. When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told. At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency. Qian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a ""Bitcoin pioneer"", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she ""never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her"". Before her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a ""glimpse of sunlight"". The cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a that will start in earnest early next year. There are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain. It is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value. As in other ""proceeds of crime"" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond. Separately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage. The toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC. Still, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine. Mr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said. ""She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst."" Mr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines: ""Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice."""
China US,Arrest made after spate of e-bike phone thefts,2025-11-18T10:10:00.003Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7402zxl193o,"A man has been arrested in connection with the thefts of mobile phones by people allegedly wearing black and riding e-bikes and e-scooters. Parts of Cambridge were targeted including Newmarket Road, Trumpington Road, Jesus Lane, Parker's Piece, Midsummer Common, near Cambridge North Station, Emmanuel Street and Christ's Pieces earlier this month. A 20-year-old man from Cambridge was arrested on Monday on suspicion of theft from a person and robbery. He was also arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, attempted theft of a motor vehicle, theft of a pedal cycle, possession of cannabis and possession of an offensive weapon. Cambridgeshire Police said a 33-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and possession of an offensive weapon. Both men have been released on bail until 16 February. Officers who carried out the warrant found suspected stolen e-bikes, bicycles and a moped. They also seized two zombie-style knives. At the time of the thefts, police said they were investigating . People with Apple phones are being urged to consider disabling the iPhone control centre on the locked screen in their settings to prevent thieves being able to put the phone in ""aeroplane"" mode when the device is locked."
China US,China exempts chips used by carmakers from export curbs,2025-11-10T07:02:17.905Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rp2514g4qo,"China has lifted export controls on computer chips vital to car production, the country's commerce ministry said on Sunday. Exemptions have been granted to exports made by Chinese-owned Nexperia for civilian use, it said, which should help carmakers who had feared production in Europe would be hit. At the same time, China has also paused an export ban to the US of some materials that are crucial in the semiconductor industry and suspended port fees for American ships. The moves mark an easing of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed in October to reduce tariffs on each other and pause other measures for a year. In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by Chinese company Wingtech, to try to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other goods. In response, China blocked exports of the firm's finished chips. However, it said earlier this month as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China. While Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries. When it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to ""serious governance shortcomings"" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency. But when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues. In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted. Earlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that ""supply shortages were imminent"". Volvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business. But on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic that China had agreed to ""the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips"" and it would ""grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter"" provided the goods were for ""civilian use"". ""Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows."" , China's commerce ministry called on ""the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible."" Prof David Bailey from Birmingham University's business school told the BBC's Today programme that the actions of China were a ""wake-up call"" for the motor industry. ""The Dutch government may well have had good reasons to try and take control but it hadn't thought through the implications of that,"" he said. ""The retaliation from China was swift and it was brutal."" He said there was a need to find alternative processing sites, ""maybe in south east Asia, or Europe"", and for the industry to keep bigger stocks of its products in case of shortages. Meanwhile, the suspension of a ban on exports of ""dual-use items"" related to gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials to the US came into effect on Sunday and will be in place until 27 November, 2026. The ban on the exports of goods and materials that can have both civilian and military uses was announced in December 2024. China's transport ministry also said port fees charged on US-linked ships would be suspended for a for a year, effective 0501 GMT Monday. On Friday, China also announced the suspension of other export controls related to expanded curbs on some rare earth materials and lithium batteries."
China US,University granted £2.5m for healthcare studies,2025-11-19T06:23:23.533Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kplp5xxw9o,"The independent regulator of higher education in England has awarded a local university almost £2.5m to create additional simulation facilities for midwife and paramedic students. In total, £2,493,703 from the Office for Students will go to the University of Worcester, which has become the third time in a row the educator has been successful in gaining such funding. According to the university, the £10.5m secured across the three rounds will benefit nearly 3,000 students. Vice chancellor and chief executive, Professor David Green, said: ""This recognition reflects the university's long and successful history of educating highly employable graduates."" The funding will enable the university to create new high-tech digitally enabled simulation rooms, including a specialist midwifery simulation suite. It will also see the purchase of a decommissioned ambulance for training paramedics. Two more highly sophisticated Anatomage tables are also set to be purchased, which show the students life-size 3D digital scans of real people who donated their bodies for science. By increasing its simulation capacity, the university said it would be able to educate even more health professionals for the future. Simon Trickett, chief executive of NHS Herefordshire and Worcestershire, said: ""This is extremely positive news for our local health and care system. ""The University of Worcester already plays a vital role in developing the highly skilled and compassionate health professionals our communities rely on, and this latest funding award will further strengthen that pipeline."""
China US,Two meals for $1: Why China's youth are not spending,2025-11-11T23:12:23.111Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pvlvdve7o,"China is facing a number of economic challenges and its government wants the next generation of consumers to start spending more for the good of all, but it is not having much luck convincing them to do so. Officials say insufficient domestic consumption across much of society is dragging on growth, but recent graduates have more reasons than most to be cautious. Youth unemployment has been hovering at just under 20% for some time, those who have jobs fear they could lose them, and the ongoing property crisis can make the prospect of home ownership seem unreachable, especially in big cities. This uncertainty is encouraging many of China's youth to instead embrace frugality, and social media has been flooded with tips on how people can survive on small amounts of money. ""My work is dedicated to a minimalist way of life,"" one full-time influencer tells the BBC. Videos by the 24-year-old, who goes by the online name Zhang Small Grain of Rice, feature content like her using a bar of ordinary soap for all her personal cleaning requirements, rather than expensive skin cleansing products. She can also be seen walking around shopping areas and showing off various bags and items of clothing which she says are good value because they'll last longer. Companies pay her to feature their goods to her 97,000 followers on the Xiaohongshu site. ""I hope more people will understand consumption traps so they can save. This will reduce their stress and relax them,"" she said. Others focus on budget eating. A 29-year-old using the name Little Grass Floating In Beijing posts videos of himself preparing basic dishes. He says he can have two meals for a little over $1 (76p). ""I am just an ordinary person from the countryside. I have neither a good educational background nor a network of influential contacts, so I must work hard for a better life"", he tells his followers. He works for an online sales firm and claims his extremely modest lifestyle has enabled him to save more than $180,000 over 6 years. Some have asked him online if he would expect his future wife and children to live the same way and what the end goal is. His response: ""I don't know"". China has developed a reputation for being an unstoppable economy, able to ride out the turmoil of the pandemic and US President Donald Trump's trade war. But analysts say it will face significant long-term challenges if it does not boost domestic spending. While the US has a problem with people racking up credit card debt, in China it's the opposite challenge. People are already inclined to save rather than spend and this only increases when there are perceptions of tough times ahead. The Chinese government has been promising for years to increase household consumption but it still accounts for only around 39% of gross domestic product (GDP), as opposed to about 60% in most developed countries. Part of the problem is that today's youth are more pessimistic than in the 1990s and early 2000s. ""Right now, making money is more important to me. I actually need to expand my income sources and cut my costs,"" a young woman in central Beijing tells the BBC. Like many other young people, her salary has been cut, she adds. ""I changed jobs, and it doesn't pay as well. Also, I don't know for how long this new job can sustain me in the future. A bad economic environment like this makes people feel down because we're not earning very much. Finding a job in the first place also isn't easy."" This level of youth unemployment - apart from spreading insecurity - makes it easier for struggling employers to cut wages because workers face a choice of accepting lower pay or diving into a highly competitive job market. A young man, also in his 20s, says there are low-level jobs available but it's hard to find decent work in one's area of expertise. ""Some of my friends are unemployed, still living at home and looking for a job,"" he says. ""They had all kinds of majors at university from financial services to product sales. The economy is a bit off right now. I hope it gets better so we can all have a better life"". And how does he rate the chances of this happening soon? ""I'm not very optimistic,"" he admits. A big concern for China's recent graduates is that the country is making a difficult transition from being a mass producer of cheap goods to a high-tech economy.  And many of these new industries don't require as many workers. Economist George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University,  has been tracking this phenomenon. He cites figures from two big recruitment firms in Beijing showing a high level of university graduates, even with master's degrees, taking jobs as delivery drivers. ""It reflects the skills mismatch between the qualifications which people are leaving higher education with and what's out there in terms of demand for labour,"" he says. ""Of course, that's not being helped by the push to become a champion in robotics and AI because, at least for the time being, this is something of a dampener on job opportunities. Tech isn't really that labour intensive."" Helena Lofgren has been studying China's consumption patterns for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs and believes its economy is relying too heavily on pouring money into preferred industries and focusing on selling products overseas in a time of considerable geopolitical uncertainty. ""People save more than they consume, and you need consumption to make up a bigger share of the economy than it's doing today in China,"" she says. ""You have a very export-oriented and investment driven economy and what we see now is that these parts are too big for the economy to stay healthy."" It is all about economic imbalance. If, for example, China suddenly lost significant export revenue would it have the tools to counter this by financially empowering its enormous domestic population? Some observers have questioned how serious the Communist Party is about increasing domestic consumption. In recent decades, the country has thrived on an investment and export model but that approach is now facing a big challenge: deflation. Would-be customers are often waiting for the price of goods to fall. If a young couple wanted to buy, say, a new lounge suite, it may make sense for them to wait to get a better deal. The longer they, and many more like them, hold off from making big purchases, the more likely companies are to cut prices, leading people to wait even longer for an even better deal. It may seem like a good idea to have cheaper goods, but deflation can force firms out of business and drag on growth overall. This could be countered by somehow fuelling optimism amongst 20 or 30-something consumers. Building a better social safety net or increasing minimum wages might help. There have been some attempts to do this by offering incentives to replace old cars, home appliances and other items but it has not significantly lifted consumption. The influencer Zhang says being cautious with spending runs deep in her country's culture. ""My grandfather's generation was very frugal, very thrifty. It is part of Chinese tradition.

China US,Fracking has transformed an Argentine town but what about the nation?,2025-11-27T00:02:47.835Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewj1e1yk2vo,"Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time. When his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires. There was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off. Then in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed. ""We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre,"" says Mr Jiménez. ""Then the town grew and passed us by."" Fuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo's population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022, In addition to these people who are already permanently settled in Añelo, there are some 15,000 industry workers who sleep in the city every night. This has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through. Last year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres. Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed. Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface. The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron. By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas. This accounts ""for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production"", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official. He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to. Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. ""We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,"" he says. ""All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta."" The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency. ""Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],"" says Mr Gadano. ""This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices."" Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports ""is very important"" for the country, ""especially when two or three years ago we were in the red"". Yet he adds that it won't be ""the panacea"" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt. ""I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,"" he says. ""However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind."" Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors. They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank. ""Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',"" explains Mr Gadano. ""That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players."" The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted. Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection. Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government ""is doing what it has to do and what it can do"". What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. ""All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,"" notes Mr Gadano. This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns. ""We are really losing in the public debate,"" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. ""There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic."" Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. ""When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day."" Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. ""Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs."""
China US,Couple's secret to 73-year marriage,2025-12-07T06:57:29.737Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgkvr7d7gdo,"A couple who have been married for 73 years say they have never seriously fallen out. Bill and Olive Miles mark each anniversary by returning to Guildford Cathedral, where they wed on 15 November 1952. The pair, now 95 and 93, met at a youth club when Olive was 16 and Bill was a couple of years older. ""I went with one boyfriend and obviously came back with another one... and I've still got the same one,"" Mrs Miles said. The couple married in front of 132 people when Mrs Miles was almost 20 and Mr Miles nearly 22, having completed his national service. She said in 1952, the ""shell"" of the cathedral was there but it is not the site seen today. It is a building that holds a lot of significance for the couple. Mrs Miles, who was born in Canada, describes Guildford Cathedral as her ""mother home"". ""I was brought up there, I was the first to be confirmed there, and it's just always been my church, it doesn't matter where else I've been,"" she said. In more than seven decades together the couple have travelled extensively, particularly after retiring, to countries including Canada, America, China, India, Nepal, Russia. Mrs Miles says they were also handy on the dance floor. ""We were reasonable dancers,"" she said. ""We did amateur dancing, and we used to go to the Butlins dancing competitions in Brighton quite often, and we maintained our dancing right up until the 60th anniversary."" The couple renewed their vows after 25 and 50 years married, and hold a reception each year to mark the occasion. These events, Mrs Miles explains, have grown smaller. ""As you get to 60 years, to 70 years, because in actual fact, when we look now at the wedding pictures of 132 guests, we are the only two left that are alive."" Their lengthy union has stood the test of time, and while there have been difficulties to manage, the Miles' remain united.

China US,WHO warning over shortage of obesity jabs ,2025-12-01T14:05:41.506Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8n0753zzo,"Fewer than one in 10 people who could benefit from obesity jabs like Wegovy are able to get them, warns the as it releases its first guidance on the drugs. With more than one billion people worldwide now obese, it is calling for more widespread and fairer access to GLP-1 medication. According to projections, more than two billion will be obese by 2030 unless action is taken. High costs, limited production capacity, and supply-chain constraints are major barriers to universal access to the injections that can help people shift significant weight, says WHO. It has already added them to its (for overweight patients with diabetes) that countries are advised to provide. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Our new guidance recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care. ""While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms."" WHO says these drugs, sometime called skinny jabs, represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity, from a ""lifestyle condition"" to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease. It says the drugs can be taken long-term -  for six months or more - but must be prescribed along with advice on diet and exercise, so that people can keep the weight off. Too few people around the world can access them, says WHO. ""Our greatest concern is equitable access,"" said Tedros. Even under the current best projected scenario, the production of GLP-1 therapies could only cover around 100 million people - less than 10% of those who need them, according to the WHO. The guideline calls on countries and companies to expand access, through strategies such as voluntary licensing - where a pharmaceutical company grants permission for others to make affordable non-brand versions of its patented drug. A patent on semaglutide - the core ingredient of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy - is due to expire in several countries in 2026, meaning other drug-makers will soon be free to produce and sell cheap versions in places like India, Canada, China, Brazil and Turkey. WHO says countries must also create healthier environments to promote good health and prevent obesity. GLP-1 drugs mimick a natural hormone to slow digestion, curb appetite and increase feelings of fullness so people eat less. In the UK, the injections are prescription only medicines, which means they can only be prescribed by a healthcare professional for a person who clinically needs it. Some are available on the NHS, but more are sold privately. There is a black market and to be safe people should avoid buying from unregulated sellers such as beauty salons or via social media. People typically start to lose weight within a few weeks of starting on the weekly injections. Research suggests people may within a year of stopping the medication though, as their normal food cravings return. Being overweight or obese increases your risk for developing health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Obesity affects people in every country and was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024, according to the WHO."
China US,'It was part of my childhood' - keeping Ulster Scots heritage alive,2025-11-30T06:14:24.371Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1kpzr152o,"For Gillian Rea, speaking Ulster Scots was a normal part of her childhood and she wants to see others enjoying the culture. A newly-minted tour guide, she has turned her dream into a reality sharing her Ulster Scots heritage with those who wish to learn the history and customs. ""People travel more now, and visit other countries,"" Gillian said. ""But sometimes we don't know what's on our doorstep. ""I think it's really important to explore the culture around you, to know who you are and where you come from in order to see where you're going."" The term Ulster Scots refers to people who migrated from the Lowlands of Scotland to Ulster in the 17th century. Now, it can refer to their heritage and cultural traditions including language, music, and dance. Gillian, who is from Kilwaughter in County Antrim, was one of several people to share readings and stories at an event in Cullybackey as part of Ulster Scots Leid (language) week. Much of Ulster Scots poetry is centred around the home, work, rural living and connection to the land. This event celebrated the weaver poets, also known as the Rhyming Weavers, who wrote in 18th and 19th century Ulster, inspired by the booming linen industry. They earned this name through their style of verse that, when read aloud, sounds like the rhythm a loom makes. An Ulster Scot historian and writer, Dr David Hume, was also at the Cullybackey event. ""At this time Ulster Scots was under pressure and these people were writing bilingually in both English and Ulster Scots,"" he said. Centuries later, Gillian said Ulster Scots is facing a new raft of challenges. ""It's important to keep that language alive, particularly in the world of technology and social media where everything is becoming very much generic with how people speak. ""There's Americanisms coming in, influenced obviously from film, TV and media. ""To counterbalance that, we've got to have more celebrations of the Ulster Scots language. ""We have to keep it alive and rich by passing on these stories."" Similar to Gillian, Davy Moore also grew up in a home where Ulster Scots was part of everyday life. ""There were five of us living in the house with my mum and dad, granny and granda,"" he said. ""We spoke this way all the time. I went to a local primary school, farmer sons and daughters went there and they also spoke like that. ""The teacher didn't correct us, she let us tear away."" It wasn't until grammar school where he felt a changing attitude towards how he spoke. ""People who didn't speak this dialect or language, they would sometimes look down on it as if you were not intelligent, or you were like a redneck."" After taking a creative writing course, Davy has since published his own novel and a collection of short stories. He hopes to one day put together his own modern book of Ulster Scots poetry, in the hope that when he's gone, a younger generation may pick it up. ""I'm not saying for one minute I'm anything like the weaver poets,"" Davy joked Those who attended the Cullybackey event discussed fond memories of growing up and hearing some words and phrases that are now very rarely used. ""Instead of fed up, you'd say I'm scundered with this weather,"" Gillian said. ""If it's cold, you would say I'm foundered."" Another is the phrase ""read up"" (pronounced like red up) which means to tidy up or clean up. Davy added the use of the word ""tovi"", which means to boast. He also enjoyed talking about the use of the word ""thran"" (stubborn or difficult) - something he joked is a common trait of Northern Irish people."
China US,Machu Picchu hit by a row over tourist buses,2025-11-24T00:06:53.799Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g8wrd61zo,"Machu Picchu, the remains of a 15th Century Inca city, is Peru's most popular tourist destination, and a Unesco world heritage site. Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated. Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes. It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk. He admits that in the past few months ""there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here"". This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport. To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg. Back in September, local protestors angry at what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process to replace Consettur blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks. This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services. A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian. Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start. It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly. ""The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,"" he says. ""This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners."" These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur. Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province. As the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class. Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: ""We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train."" Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site ""was a nightmare for us"". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57. The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally. ""Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages."" He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment. Outside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that ""more needs to be done for the local communities"". She adds: ""We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition."" Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He wants to see more state oversight of public transport in Peru. ""We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,"" he says. ""If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term."" He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather. ""[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,"" says Mr Gonzalez. ""And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion."" But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years. ""I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to."" Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Torontoy run buses to and from Machu Picchu. ""If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them."""
China US,The curious case of why Poundland is struggling during a cost-of-living crisis,2025-11-21T08:03:37.342Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkgxeeyzno,"""Everyone comes in here, it's very cheap. I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries,"" says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. ""It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?"" The store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis. Instead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street. More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid ""challenging trading conditions"". It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year. Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales. These places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops. So why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time? One thing is clear - we're not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed. ""[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops,"" says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. ""[They're doing this] by saying, 'These are things I'm going to buy from you.' ""They know their prices inside out."" Sometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices. But that's not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition. All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers. For pound shops in particular, it's even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn't what it used to be. After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today. Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago. In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above. ""We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,"" he says. ""What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous."" But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right. His Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries. ""We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they're going to buy it,"" he declares. As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers. ""We've got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices,"" he says. So, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of ""extra margin"". If you don't get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel. The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later. ""They just didn't understand the discount business,"" he argues. ""They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it."" Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs. Poundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making. The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. Its owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn't popular with shoppers. ""Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth. But she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan. This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead. The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then. Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents. And shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains. Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes. By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car. But budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis. Not only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of ""extreme discounting"" online to contend with. Today, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There's also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers. ""AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it's growing,"" says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel. Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period. Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul. ""If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you'd find on Temu etc, so if Amazon's doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it's notable,"" says Mr Carroll. ""There's a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come."" There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock. ""As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that,"" she says. ""It's not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody."" The danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market. All this coupled with a ""cost-of-business crisis"" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth. ""You've got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you're at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it's super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there's so many people in that market. ""But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out."" It's not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently. The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too. Savers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland's Peckham store space. OneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs. ""Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing."" As for current trading, he says, he is getting by. ""We're not saying we're earning fortunes of money. We're not - but we're paying our way, and we're just waiting for better times."" His focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading. ""It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas,"" he says. Catherine Shuttleworth reckons that's where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. ""They're a great place to go and deck your house out.""

China US,What was agreed on climate change at COP30 in Brazil?,2025-11-22T21:34:13.368Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gqez4lkyo,"Countries have reached a new deal to tackle climate change at the annual UN meeting in Belém, Brazil. But , with no new measures on fossil fuels or deforestation. COP30 was the 30th annual UN climate meeting. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"". ""Parties"" refers to the nearly 200 countries that have signed up to the original UN climate agreement of 1992. COP30 was due to run from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. But the talks overran into Saturday 22 November. World leaders gathered on Thursday 6 and Friday 7 November, before the conference began. The host nation is chosen by participating countries after a nomination from the host region. The conference was held in Brazil for the first time. The choice of Belém, on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, caused significant challenges. Some delegations struggled to book affordable accommodation, leading to concerns that poorer nations could be priced out. The decision to to build a road for the summit also proved controversial. Brazil also continued to grant which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were among those to attend the leaders' summit. UN secretary general António Guterres and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were also there. The Prince of Wales, attending on behalf of King Charles, gave a speech calling for countries to come together to tackle the ""fast-approaching"" threats of future climate change. But many leaders were absent, including China's President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. China and the US are the two biggest emitters of planet-warming gases. Delegations from more than 190 countries, including a large number from China, attended the talks, however. The US government did not send any national officials, although some local and state leaders did attend. Politicians and diplomats were joined by scientists, campaigners and journalists. Previous summits have been criticised for the large number of attendees who are connected to the coal, oil and gas industries. Campaigners argue this shows . COP30 took place at a time when global climate targets were under significant strain. In Paris in 2015, nearly 200 countries to 1.5C above ""pre-industrial"" levels and to keep them ""well below"" 2C. There is very strong scientific evidence that the impacts of climate change - from extreme heat to sea-level rise - would be far greater at 2C than at 1.5C. But while the use of renewable energy - particularly solar power - is , countries' climate plans have fallen short of what the 1.5C goal requires. Ahead of COP30, countries were supposed to have submitted updated plans detailing how they would cut their emissions of planet-warming gases. However, had done so by the end of October. UN secretary general António Guterres warned that ""overshooting"" 1.5C is inevitable, given how close the target is and how high emissions remain. But he said he hoped temperatures could still be brought back down to the target by the end of the century. Brazil hoped to agree steps to deliver commitments made at previous COPs. At COP28, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2023, about the need to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"". Brazil wanted the talks to secure clearer steps for how countries would achieve this. The idea of such a ""roadmap"" had been backed by dozens of countries, including the UK, but was strongly opposed by others, including those reliant on fossil fuels. In the end, the deal mentioned that existing UAE agreement - but did not strengthen the language around moving away from fossil fuels. Brazil announced its own plan to launch a fossil fuel ""roadmap"" which countries could sign up to - but it sits outside the main deal. At COP29, richer countries committed to give developing nations to help them tackle climate change. But that is far less than poorer countries say they need. That agreement also included an aspiration to raise this to $1.3tn from public and private sources. Ahead of COP30, Brazil published a ""roadmap"" detailing how the $1.3tn goal could be achieved. The COP30 deal called for a trebling of money to help the worst affected nations to adapt to the impacts of climate change, by 2035. But it's not clear how much will come from public versus private sources. And richer nations have consistently undelivered on their cash promises. At the leaders' summit ahead of COP30, Brazil launched the ""Tropical Forests Forever Facility"" - a fund which hopes to raise $125bn (£96bn) from loans and investments. The aim is to try to prevent the loss of tropical forests by rewarding countries who keep their forests standing. But the UK said it would not be committing public money - though could do so in the future and would encourage the private sector to invest. Brazil announced plans to launch a roadmap outlining steps to meet the pledge to halt and reverse deforestation, which was made in COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. But, like fossil fuels, this deforestation roadmap did not make it into the final deal. UN climate talks rely on consensus - all countries present have to agree in order to pass a deal. That can be challenging. Different nations have competing priorities, based for example on their dependence on fossil fuels, economic position or vulnerability to climate change. The backdrop for the talks this year was dominated by the fracturing consensus on tackling climate change, not least from the Trump administration. The US President has pledged to , and roll back green initiatives put in place by his predecessors. Some observers, such as campaigner Greta Thunberg, have accused previous COPs of ""greenwashing"" - letting countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without actually making the changes needed. Significant global agreements have been reached at previous COP sessions, allowing greater progress than national measures on their own. Despite the difficulties of delivering the 1.5C warming limit, the commitment - agreed at COP21 in Paris - has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN. This has helped bring down the level of anticipated warming - even though the world is still not acting at the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals. But the view from many scientists and observers is that the agreements made at COP30 are unlikely to shift the dial much on climate change. to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

China US,Teen builds advanced robotic hand from Lego,2025-11-26T06:13:34.165Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g1001z95o,"A teenager has designed and built a fully working robotic hand out of Lego pieces. Jared Lepora, 16, from Bristol, spent about two years on the creation, assisted by his father Nathan who is a professor in robotics at the University of Bristol. ""My dad specialises in making advanced robot hands and I thought these principles were always really cool, so why not make it out of Lego?” Jared said. Nathan hopes the Lego hand, which can pick up variety of objects including fruits and cups, could one day become a ""proper Lego set for other children"" to build. The hand, which is driven by two motors using tendons, has four fingers, each functioning with three joints. Using Lego clutch gears, the mechanics of the fingers move together until they touch an object then stop moving, similar to a human hand. After building the hand and jointly writing an academic paper on it with his father, Jared was invited to give a speech at the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025 conference in Hangzhou, China, and was the youngest speaker there. Nathan said he used to take his son into the lab during summer holidays, where he got familiar with 3D-printed designs while chatting with PhD students. ""And he had the idea of making one out of Lego...maybe he'll become my boss someday,"" he said. ""This genuinely could be of interest to other children to engage with advanced robotics, it's a way in for them. ""If anyone can build the hand, and maybe other children can make design changes, then that's really exciting. ""Wouldn't it be amazing if it could be a proper Lego set for other children, that would be exciting,"" he added."

China US,E-commerce platform breach exposes nearly 34 million customers' data,2025-12-01T04:08:47.438Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36zwywll02o,"South Korea's largest online retailer, Coupang, has apologised for a massive data breach potentially involving nearly 34 million local customer accounts. The country's internet authority said that it is investigating the breach and that details from the millions of accounts have likely been exposed. The e-commerce platform is often described as South Korea's equivalent of Amazon.com. The breach marks the latest in a series of data leaks at major firms in the country, including its telecommunications giant, SK Telecom. Coupang told the BBC it became aware of the unauthorised access of personal data of about 4,500 customer accounts on 18 November and immediately reported it to the authorities. But later checks found that some 33.7 million customer accounts - all in South Korea - were likely exposed, said Coupang, adding that the breach is believed to have begun as early as June through a server based overseas. The exposed data is limited to name, email address, phone number, shipping address and some order histories, Coupang said. No credit card information or login credentials were leaked. Those details remain securely protected and no action is required from Coupang users at this point, the firm added. The number of accounts affected by the incident represents more than half of South Korea's roughly-52 million population. Coupang, which is founded in South Korea and headquartered in the US, said recently that it had nearly 25 million active users. Coupang apologised to its customers and warned them to stay alert to scams impersonating the company. The firm did not give details on who is behind the breach. South Korean media outlets reported on Sunday that a former Coupang employee from China was suspected of being behind the breach. The authorities are assessing the scale of the breach as well as whether Coupang had broken any data protection safety rules, South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT said in a statement. ""As the breach involves the contact details and addresses of a large number of citizens, the Commission plans to conduct a swift investigation and impose strict sanctions if it finds a violation of the duty to implement safety measures under the Protection Act."" Coupang has faced multiple cyber-security breaches in recent years, including one incident that exposed 460,000 customers' data. Major South Korean organisations have delivered harsh criticism over the latest breach. The editorial board of local newspaper Chosun Ilbo described the incident as ""preposterous"" and called for strong sanctions on firms responsible for leaks of its customer data. Another local media outlet, the Dong-A Ilbo, said the breach is ""the worst personal data leak"" in Korean history. The media outlet questioned how long the incident went unnoticed, adding that it ""means their internal data protection system barely mattered."" The breach marks the latest in a series of cyber-security incidents affecting major South Korean companies this year, despite the country's reputation for stringent data privacy rules. SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile operator, was fined nearly $100m (£76m) over a data breach involving more than 20 million subscribers. In September, Lotte Card also said the data of nearly three million customers was leaked after a cyber-attack on the credit card firm."
China US,"Buy nothing new this Black Friday, says charity",2025-11-28T06:34:36.406Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2evx9l0y2o,"A reuse charity is asking people to consider second hand this Black Friday as part of an alternative national campaign called Buy Nothing New. Kennet Furniture Refurbiz (KFR), based in Devizes, Wiltshire, collects second hand donations of furniture, homeware and appliances and is part of the national reuse network, a group of organisations which take on items to help others and sell affordably. KFR said it has passed on about 18,000 items, weighing about 340 tonnes over the last year. Daniel Thompson, managing director at KFR, said: ""We've just got to get our message out there. The reuse sector is growing, is rapidly more accepted into society."" He believes the stigma of secondhand is going: ""You've got various websites online where you can buy repurposed items, clothing, etc. I think reuse is on the up. ""Cost of living crisis is extreme at the moment so people don't necessarily have the money to spend on new items for Christmas. ""We are an alternative to that. We are an alternative to the consuming on Black Friday."" There are often Black Friday deals on appliances, but Mr Thompson explained that when they get second hand ones in to clean and refurbish, there is usually very little wrong with them, or can be quickly fixed. He explained that while recycling some items can be a good way to go, the process still produces emissions, so ""by reusing things you're generating far less carbon"". Of the 18,000 goods passed on last year by KFR, more than 7,000 were furniture and nearly 3,800 were electrical. Jen Gale, from Warminster, Wiltshire, runs a blog and podcast called Sustainable(ish) - she and her family have previously done a year of buying nothing new. She said that Black Friday can be useful if someone has a ""specific item in mind, Black Friday can be a real helping hand in terms of some financial savings"". ""I guess it becomes problematic when it's really just encouraging us to consume and to buy things that we didn't know we wanted, we don't necessarily need, and just really, encouraging that very sort of mindless and thoughtless consumption,"" she said. KFR has found itself expanding in a few ways: earlier this year it teamed up with another charity to offer house clearances. It has an arrangement with household recycling centres in Wiltshire and has opened a new location in Swindon too. It is also used by the local councils to provide furniture and appliances for those in need through the household support fund - last year this helped nearly 700 households."
China US,Obstacle racing 'makes me feel like a superhero',2025-11-11T06:39:32.246Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dr8np8551o,"A Wiltshire athlete who just took bronze at the Obstacle World Championships says the sport makes her feel like she can ""fly like a superhero"". Mila Stanzani, from Trowbridge, told the BBC that getting her first podium finish at the championships in China last month was ""incredible and very surreal"". The sport of obstacle course racing is set to replace the fifth event in the modern pentathlon - which is currently equestrian - at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. But Stanzani hopes it will become a stand alone Olympic event in the future. The 27 year-old took bronze at the inaugural UIPM 2025 Obstacle World Championships held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing. Stanzani competed in the 100m sprint race held at China's National Olympic Sports Centre in Beijing, which saw athletes race across a course made up of 11 different obstacles similar to what you would see on a Ninja Warrior track. On BBC Wiltshire's Sport at Six show, she said it is ""very thrilling, it's like a puzzle you need to try and solve it, but be fast as well"". Obstacle course racing (OCR) athletes need ""incredible grip strength, precision, accuracy"" according to Stanzani as well as ""a bit of confidence"". She was introduced to the sport when she was 19 years-old and hopes to become an Olympian if the sport does become its own discipline in the future. She is currently the fastest female in the sport in the UK, and said she will ""keep eating my rice and peas and just hope for the best""."
China US,"Shoppers loved the 'fabric queen'. Then, order by order, her story fell apart",2025-12-05T19:02:48.772Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y937w7xl7o,"At 6ft tall and plus-size, shop-bought clothes had never fitted Maree O'Connor well. Sewing offered her a solution - allowing her to use beautiful fabrics to make garments that fit just right. One day, while on the lookout for colourful prints to make new dresses, she spotted some ""amazing"" fabrics being sold online. Enticed by a yellow floral pattern and another black-and-white abstract design, she splashed out $600 (£450, A$900) on three orders. Months later, none had arrived. It was October 2024, and tired of waiting, the legal studies teacher from Melbourne, Australia, decided to set up a Facebook group to try to find out if anyone else was in the same boat. The group exploded. Within two weeks it had drawn hundreds of members, according to Ms O'Connor. She had unearthed a scandal that would consume the sewing world - from China to Europe, to the US. In the group, other sewing enthusiasts detailed how they too had been waiting months - and in some cases years - for fabrics to arrive, while a supplier alleged it was owed tens of thousands of dollars. At the centre of the controversy was globally renowned designer, Nerida Hansen. Her company had grown rapidly during the pandemic, when she made a name for herself selling bold, distinctive fashion prints that set her shop apart from other retailers. Popular with sewists - as members of the sewing community call themselves - around the world, her fabrics often appeared in influencers' Instagram posts. Some newspapers had even dubbed her Australia's queen of fabrics. ""People liked what she was doing and producing,"" said UK-based artist Gabriela Larios, who has worked with Ms Hansen. ""My impression of her was that she was doing something different and new in Australia,"" added Sarah Rowe, another artist who worked with Ms Hansen. ""I was impressed by her, she was formidable."" That's exactly what excited Bergen Anderson, who ordered more than $3,300 (£2,500; A$5,000) of Ms Hansen's fabrics in 2024. She planned to use them to make clothes which she would sell through her US-based children's clothing business. But, as in Ms O'Connor's experience, none of Ms Anderson's goods arrived within the eight-week window that was promised. Instead, she received a number of what she described as ""generic"" emails, saying her orders were soon to be printed and shipped. She also received a number of emails from Ms Hansen saying suppliers were delayed sending goods because of events like national holidays. ""It was every excuse under the sun,"" Ms Anderson said. Frustrated and in search of answers, she too stumbled upon Ms O'Connor's Facebook group. In it, she found customers wondering where their money had gone - and why the company was still accepting orders even though so many people were saying their fabrics hadn't been printed or shipped. Suspicious of Ms Hansen's business practices, Ms O'Connor encouraged customers to request refunds and dispute transactions with their banks. Ms Anderson only managed to get two out of three payments reversed through her bank, meaning she was still $808 (£606; A$1,224) out of pocket. Meanwhile, Ms Hansen had become aware of the Facebook group and contacted Ms O'Connor asking for it to be taken down, claiming that content posted in the group was defamatory - a claim Ms O'Connor rejected. Ms O'Connor said Ms Hansen also offered her an immediate refund if she no longer wished to wait for her goods. ""I got my refund pretty much straight away, because she wanted to shut me up."" But she decided not to shut up - or delete the group. ""She was just going to continue to do what she was doing, and take money from people because people were siloed right, they didn't know what was going on."" In the group people were sounding alarm bells about announcements from Ms Hansen saying she was rebranding, worried about what that would mean for their undelivered orders. Ms Hansen went on to trade under a number of different business names online. By then the group had grown beyond disgruntled customers to also include Nerida Hansen's suppliers. William Shan worked for a supplier in China that sold material to Ms Hansen's company - until, he said, the payments stopped. He was ""helpless"" when he ""accidentally discovered"" the Facebook group, he said. Mr Shan alleged Ms Hansen's firm failed to pay for two fabric shipments worth $52,000 (£39,000; A$78,700) in 2022. He said he initially felt sympathy for Ms Hansen, who he thought ""may have encountered difficulties"". He continued supplying her in the hope it would ""help her recover as soon as possible and collect her [company's] debts"". But he says later orders - worth thousands of dollars - also went unpaid. ""We [trusted Nerida] too much. From 2020 to the end of 2021, Nerida's credit [had] been consistently good. So we did this stupid thing of continuing to supply her,"" Mr Shan said. Mr Shan's company said it had hired numerous lawyers to try to recover the money owed by Ms Hansen's companies, but she and her business associates stopped communicating. The BBC also spoke to 11 artists and illustrators who said they had not been paid for their work with Ms Hansen's brand. Clémence Albertus, based in France, said she had been approached by Ms Hansen at an art fair in Paris about collaborating on fabric prints. Given Ms Hansen was ""really known for her fabrics"", Ms Albertus said she chose to trust her. According to Ms Albertus, Ms Hansen wanted to license one of her designs to be sold in collaboration with a large European fabric retailer called Verhees - an opportunity Ms Albertus didn't want to miss out on. But after sending over her design, a delicate floral print, she heard nothing from Ms Hansen for months. ""I thought Verhees changed their mind, or that the collaboration Nerida x Verhees failed,"" Ms Albertus said. That was until one day in August last year, when she discovered her pattern ""by chance"" for sale on the Verhees website. She said it had been edited in different colourways without her consultation. Ms Albertus contacted Ms Hansen numerous times asking about royalty statements and payment details but is yet to receive any money. ""It has been a real deception,"" she said, adding that she estimates she is owed €2,000-€4,000 (£1750-3500; A$3,500-7,000). Verhees told the BBC it was not responsible for royalty payments owed to designers featured in its collection, and that Ms Hansen was solely responsible for paying these. It added it had now suspended the Nerida Hansen x Verhees collaboration. Not all the artists who spoke to the BBC felt Ms Hansen was totally to blame for the lack of payments from her businesses. Bron Alexander, based in New Zealand, said while she was owed payments for previous projects with Ms Hansen, it was her own fault she hadn't been paid for her Verhees collection work as she'd failed to provide invoices when asked by Ms Hansen's team. Ms Alexander added that she believed Ms Hansen was a ""visionary"" and said she had ""much empathy"" for her financial situation. ""She only ever wanted us [artists] to be successful."" Others insisted business simply wasn't Ms Hansen's forte. ""I truly believe she wanted the best for everybody, I truly believe she wanted to be able to deliver, I truly believe she wanted to be able to pay everybody,"" said Sarah Rowe, an artist who used to collaborate with Ms Hansen and is not owed any money. ""I really believe she had good intentions to do all those things, and I also believe business is not her jam."" Ms O'Connor felt differently. ""I think she's quite intentional in what she's doing,"" she said. ""If she was a disorganised businesswoman she would have quit a while ago."" In September 2025, nearly a year after Ms O'Connor started the Facebook group, a public warning against Ms Hansen and her businesses was issued by the Victoria state consumer rights agency. It was the result of multiple complaints - Ms O'Connor had advised fellow customers on the group to report their experiences to Australian authorities. ""I urge consumers to be wary about purchasing goods from Hansen's online platforms or engaging further with Hansen,"" Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV) director Nicole Rich said. The warning said that over the course of one year, the agency had been contacted more than 120 times by customers claiming to have lost more than $19,800 (£14,900; A$30,000) in purchases. It also said Ms Hansen had operated online under a range of business names, including Indigo Palm, The Kind Merch Co, Nerida Hansen Fabrics, Rebel Quilts, Australian Surface Art Collective, Fabric and Design and Nerida Hansen Print and Textiles. Ms Hansen said this was untrue, denying she used all of these to trade. After the warning was issued, Ms Hansen announced she would be shutting down her businesses by the end of the month to start a new career. But she continued promoting fabric sales on the website domain names Global De-stash and neridahansen.com into November. In a statement to the BBC, Ms Hansen admitted she had made some ""very poor"" decisions relating to her businesses, adding her actions had caused her ""great shame and embarrassment"". She said she had experienced financial difficulties that led to her liquidating her company in late 2022 - before opening a new one in a new name. Following that, she said she fell further behind with orders in 2024, citing supplier issues and business mismanagement, but insisted she was still in control of the situation. ""Even though I mismanaged orders terribly I was steering my own business wheel,"" she said. She had intended to have all orders completed by the end of January 2025, she said, but the creation of the Facebook group had led to a wave of refund requests and bank chargebacks being submitted all at the same time. This left the business overwhelmed, Ms Hansen said, and caused her trading account to be frozen. She still intended to fulfil every order and refund owed to her customers, she stated, but did not currently have the means to do so. She alleged the attention brought to her businesses online by Ms O'Connor's Facebook group had amounted to ""horrific social media harassment"" and defamation. She claimed Ms O'Connor went beyond advocating for justice online. She accused her of encouraging others in the Facebook group to engage in what she describes as amounting to ""digital stalking"" and ""physical stalking"", and that Ms O'Connor ""publicly made deliberate attempts to sabotage [her] livelihood"". Ms O'Connor disputed these allegations saying they were ""outrageous"". ""Customers being persistent and demanding in terms of seeking a refund or product that the vendor had happily taken money for is not harassment,"" she said. Despite everything that has happened, Ms O'Connor is determined to continue sewing - though she insists she will never wear any of Nerida Hansen's designs again. She will continue to fight until Ms Hansen's businesses are shut down, she says. ""Some people are still awaiting justice and we hope that can be achieved."""
China US,PIP withdrawn from amputee over cricket video,2025-12-04T06:40:46.648Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9z00y2p1yo,"The family of a man who lost his leg when he was two years old have asked for a rethink of a decision to strip him of his disability benefits and force him to pay back £36,000. Shaun Rigby from Telford had his Personal Independence Payment (PIP) withdrawn after a video emerged, showing him take part in a game of cricket. But his family said: ""Playing cricket does not negate Shaun's disability; it showcases his determination to lead a fulfilling life despite it."" The Department of Work and Pensions said its decision had been backed by an independent tribunal and PIPs were ""awarded based on how a condition impacts a person's day-to-day needs, as opposed to the condition itself"". In an online petition, Mr Rigby's family said he had ""overcome incredible odds since losing his leg below the knee in a tragic tractor accident when he was just two years old"". They said despite his physical challenges, the 37-year-old had tried to ""live as fully as possible, embracing activities like cricket not only for his own mental and physical health but also to share joyful moments with his family"". Mr Rigby said he used to play for England's disability cricket team, before eventually having to give it up. He said: ""I stopped playing about 2014, just because I couldn't do what I wanted to do, my body was sort of breaking down."" Since then, he said the pain became worse and he was successful in applying for PIP in 2016 and a Motability car three years later. But the DWP decided to withdraw both after their attention was drawn to the video of him playing cricket in 2023. His family said it had been ""a light-hearted community cricket match"". They argued that ""participating in adaptive sports is a well-known form of rehabilitation and psychological well-being for individuals with disabilities"". The decision to strip him of his benefits took away his independence and his ability to care for his family, they said. Mr Rigby said he understood why the DWP had made the decision, but wanted the government department to know he played despite his condition and did it partly to inspire others. He said he would undergo six days of ""torture"" after playing, because of the pain. The family has asked the DWP to reassess his case and reverse the decision. His wife, Lauren, said losing the PIP payments was difficult in itself, but the thought of having to repay the £36,000 was causing the family ""stress and worry"". ""Do they want us to go into poverty?"" she asked. Mrs Rigby added she wanted to push back at some of the negative comments they had received after it was announced he would lose the payment, but that there had been ""nothing but good comments"" since the online petition was launched. The DWP said: ""Following Mr Rigby's appeal, where he was able to challenge his benefit entitlement, an independent tribunal agreed with DWP's decision."" It also said that every PIP claim was different, because of individual circumstances  ""including age and the ability to manage a condition without supervision or assistance"". Mr Rigby is waiting to hear what the weekly repayments will be on the £36,000 and believes it could be up to £35 a week. The DWP said it was committed to working with anyone struggling with repayment terms."
China US,Sale of Daily Telegraph collapses after US firm pulls out,2025-11-14T14:43:29.958Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993drmj1dyo,"US investment group RedBird Capital has pulled out of a deal to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph for £500m. RedBird had a previous attempt to buy the Telegraph rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi's IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family. A law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals. The new bid complied with that rule, but it is understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review. A spokesman for the group said: ""RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group. ""We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and we will work hard to help secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers."" Sources close to RedBird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest. RedBird itself has faced questions over the extent of investment it has received from China and Gulf based investors. An IMI Group spokesperson said its ""priority has been to end the uncertainty and secure the Telegraph's long-term success"" and that it remained in contact with ""interested parties"" on a deal. It said it remained committed to completing a sale, while co-operating with the government and regulators. RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market. Among other investments, RedBird Capital owns the Italian football team AC Milan. The Daily Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the RedBird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph's previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers."
China US,More than 100 Aston Martin jobs 'at risk' in St Athan  ,2025-11-07T19:10:05.727Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c874wxdgqv3o,"More than 100 jobs are at risk at the Aston Martin St Athan plant in the Vale of Glamorgan, BBC Wales has been told. The company has blamed losses on US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and weak demand from China. Aston Martin, which started production in south Wales in 2019, said its proposals remain under consultation but no final figures on jobs have been confirmed. The Unite union described the situation as ""devastating"" and said it would begin a consultation with the company to mitigate redundancies. in response to continued challenges in the global macro-economic environment. It said the actions it was taking ""may affect contractor, fixed-term and permanent roles"". Staff production jobs make up the majority of roles being consulted on as well as a number of contractor positions, BBC Wales was told. Andrew Pearson, Unite regional officer, said the news was ""devastating"" for the workforce at Aston Martin. Aston Martin has seen its shares tumble during the year and last month said it faced losing £110m due to the ""global macroeconomic environment"". The Welsh government said it is in contact with Aston Martin and is prepared to to work with the company to offer support to workers following the outcome of the consultation. The current round of potential job cuts follow a decision by the company to cut 170 jobs at St Athan in February."
China US,Marsh solar park plans questioned by campaigners,2025-11-27T06:00:25.703Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrvjkr1jxo,"Campaigners against proposals to build three large-scale solar parks claim the government's ambition to treble the amount of solar capacity in the UK is ""fundamentally flawed"" and ""damaging"". Amanda Farrant, who lives near the proposed Shepway Energy Park, says if plans are approved it would be ""like living in the middle of a massive, great big solar power station"". Three solar parks being put forward for Romney Marsh in Kent are at various stages of planning and consultation. None have yet been submitted to the planning inspectorate. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said solar contributed in 2024. Opponents to the Romney Marsh plans they will damage unique and fragile habitats and take up productive farm land. Ms Farrant, who formed the Hands Off Our Marsh campaign, believes there are better options to solar energy calling it ""too intermittent"" and that the government's solar ambitions are generating a solar ""gold rush"". ""It's all about speed and getting it done quickly,"" she claimed, adding the approach could lead to ""devastation"" of the rural environment. There is scepticism from some about the effectiveness of solar panels. Prof Tony Day, an independent energy consultant and visiting professor at London South Bank University, said the government target would only deliver 2-3.5% of national energy needs in the depths of winter. ""Even in the peak of summer the average monthly power output is around one fifth of headline capacity figure,"" Prof Day said. ""No other generation asset would be considered viable with this type of delivery or energy risk profile."" The government's hopes the UK will have 45-47GW of solar capacity by 2030. Proposals for a 500MW South Kent Energy Park in Old Romney would see more than 1,400 acres turned over to solar. Plans for the 200MW Shepway Energy Park, near Newchurch, see an area made up of six sites covering more than 1,000 acres. South Brooks Solar Farm's 500MW plan is made up of several sites potentially over more than 2,700 acres. If approved they would be three of the biggest solar parks in the country. Due to the size of the proposals they are classed as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) and the decision to approve or reject the plans is made at a national level, not by local councils. Since coming to power Labour has approved 11 NSIP solar parks around the UK. Colin Woollard, who lives and works on Romney Marsh, bought 256 solar panels from China in 2023 to power his motorsport engineering manufacturing business, with a 140KW capacity. He says when he bought them he was sold the idea that it would work all year round. ""It just doesn't,"" he said. Mr Woollard said on a cloudy day in November they only generated 21 kilowatts, which he said was ""basically seven kettles of water"". He questioned the ability to ""run a country"" on such an inefficient model. The government says solar offers potential to boost the country's energy independence, bring down bills and tackle the climate crisis. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""Solar is one of the cheapest forms of power and – alongside upgrades to the electricity grid – will help us get us off fossil fuels and delivering energy security so we can get bills down for good. ""All projects are subject to rigorous planning processes, and the views of the local community must be taken into account."" The three developers of the proposed sites said they had consulted residents and that the feedback would help to inform the projects."
China US,"We will be hammered in the budget, says 64-year-old",2025-11-21T06:03:47.304Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8e7zv510no,"A man in his sixties with disabilities says he feels he will ""get hammered"" whatever happens in the Budget announcement on 26 November. Andy Watson, 64, lives in Stotfold, Bedfordshire, and has serious mobility problems. He has also had a liver transplant and two types of cancer. He says he was hoping that some of the in the budget do not turn out to be true. When sitting with a cigarette in his mouth in the room where he spends most of his life, Andy Watson does not look like a survivor. But somehow, he says, he is still ""living and breathing"". After receiving a lung transplant 22 years ago, he was diagnosed with lung cancer eight years ago. Bowel cancer followed in 2022, along with back problems. ""My spine is poking into the spinal cord,"" he said, ""so walking is very difficult, very very painful. ""I've been receiving injections in the spine for the last few years, but you're only allowed so many of them and they stopped."" Mr Watson says he is on a waiting list for hospital treatment, but in the meantime  his mobility is ""lousy"" so he is ""stuck in the house"" apart from visits to a nearby coffee shop. ""Whatever happens in the budget,"" he said, ""we know we're going to get hammered. ""I'm just hoping [the government] are going to breach their manifesto and there's a call to arms by everybody for them to have another election. ""It's gone beyond the point of saying 'yeah, they've just got in, they've got to find their feet'."" Mr Watson believes the economy has only got worse over the past 18 months and the government is ""just investing more and more money on immigrants"". He believes paying £49.18 a week to asylum seekers has resulted in the government being forced to consider new unpopular charges in the budget. He also spoke against the government housing migrants in hotels as the accommodation was ""still a hotel, still a nice little holiday joint"". concluded that while the media and politicians ""depict people seeking asylum as living in luxury...  the reality could not be more different."" The government said it would , saving the taxpayer billions of pounds. Mr Watson says pensioners are suffering financially despite ""contributing to the country all these years - but Mr Starmer don't think about that, it's a joke"". The state pension is currently £230.25 per week while the allowance for an asylum seeker goes down to £9.95 per week if their accommodation supplies meals. Mr Watson said his own income, which is made up of a Personal Independence Payment, Employment and Support Allowance and a mobility allowance, was ""a couple of hundred pounds a week to live on [and I] contribute towards running a house, buying food"". Mr Watson said: ""[The government is] on about taxing your mileage. ""Scrap the road tax - just put it on the petrol [so] we're all paying equal."" A spokesperson for the Treasury said Vehicle Excise Duty was forecast to raise approximately £9.1bn in the current financial year, which would go towards funding public services. Mr Watson would like some measures in the budget to give him a little more income: ""I'm very lucky, my wife has retired, so she has a pension. ""She pays the majority of the bills and the running costs, other than that it's very, very tight. ""It would be lovely to be off on nice holidays and all the rest, but you can't do it."" He said he enjoyed a ""couple of little mini-breaks a year"" with his wife Liz in the UK. Before his health forced him to give up his job eight years ago, Mr Watson was running a shop selling mobility aids. ""We miss it,"" he says, ""we miss the banter - it was lovely to help people."" Although he has left the world of business behind, he has a keen interest in what owners of small businesses are going through. At the moment, bosses have to register for VAT if their turnover over 12 months is greater than £90,000. The think tank, The Resolution Foundation, has suggested the government drops the threshold to just £30,000 to increase competition, but Mr Watson is not impressed. ""What a joke,"" he said, ""I know a few shopkeepers, they're closing earlier now, because they are frightened to death of going over and into the VAT."""
China US,"'Tell me, how do I make money Rachel Reeves?'",2025-11-30T06:25:48.578Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75vwg51wxgo,"Once a chancellor has delivered their Budget speech in Parliament, it is usual they visit somewhere for a photo opportunity and pitch policies to the country. Rachel Reeves chose a London hospital to highlight her commitment to the NHS. But she would have been very welcome in Braintree, Essex, at Toast – an East Anglian coffee chain that sources many of its ingredients locally. Whether she would have enjoyed hearing the thoughts of owner Rob Ely is a different matter. ""It feels like the government are literally taxing us on everything they possibly can,"" he said. Mr Ely is reeling from what he feels is another blow for his business, after a recent rise in national insurance payments and pension contributions. ""I would absolutely welcome Rachel Reeves - come to my business. I will give you an open book. You tell me how I make money?"" Mr Ely has six coffee shops.  When we meet in person, nearly every table in his Colchester store is full at lunchtime and there is a steady stream of customers coming in for their takeaway brews. He wants a profit margin of 10% but says increased taxes, costs and wages mean it is not achievable, leaving him frustrated. an hour from April - slightly higher than the current inflation rate of 3.6% - and 8.5% for 18-20 year-olds to £10.85 . ""It's fantastic for all of those people that are going to get more money in their pocket, he said. ""I heard the Chief Secretary [to the Treasury] said it is a slight increase.  That is not a slight increase, it is a big increase. It is going to cost me £70-£80,000 a year,"" Mr Ely claimed. Prices at Toast almost certainly will have to go up, but he said there is a limit to how much people will hand over for a cup of coffee. Matt Kimber is standing on his bustling Basildon factory floor. ""I'm genuinely more positive than I was"" he said after the Budget Mr Kimber is managing director of family-run metal works company GK Engineering. It makes steel structures like staircases for NHS hospitals and new apartment blocks.  The firm employs 50 people and has a £9m turnover. ""We've seen some good things about public spending in our sector. There's some good things about apprenticeships. We are not overly impacted by minimum wage.  They are a skilled workforce so we are above minimum wage,"" the 36 year-old boss said. But Mr Kimber feels there is still ""some uncertainty"" as a lot of the measures announced won't start for a couple of years. Darren Sharp is one of the welders at GK Engineering and he feels in the past five years things have got financially tighter. The Chancellor said ""cutting the cost of living"" was one of her three priorities in the Budget - along with cutting NHS waiting times and the cost of debt. But after this Budget, Mr Sharp said: ""For me personally, it's not going have that much of an effect. ""I don't think they have been spending money in the right places. I would like to see them spend more on defence with threats from Russia and China."" He has older children so will not be affected by the two-child benefit cap being scrapped but the 54 year-old welcomed the freezing of prescription charges. The owner of the Dragonfly Lounge in Colchester, an LGBTQ+ bar and community space, was uncertain of its future pre-Budget. Jo Palmer-Tweed said Rachel Reeves' second Budget was ""a mixed bag"". ""I'm very pleased about the business rates decision for hospitality because that is potentially quite a big cut.  That was very pleasing,"" she said. The Chancellor announced that there will be permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses from next year in properties with an annual rental value less than £500,000. The Dragonfly Lounge opened earlier this year and its property hasn't been valued yet but Ms Palmer-Tweed is hopeful it will lead to a reduction. She said they will be ""impacted"" by the rise in national living wage and the freezing of the income tax thresholds. ""The income tax hikes are going to impact different parts of our customer base. ""Overall for us in the shorter term [the Budget] has been good for us. But in the longer term it's going to really depend in how it shakes out in terms of customer spending,"" the owner of the Dragonfly Lounge said. Before the Budget, Ms Palmer-Tweed, also known as Mamma Dragonfly, was worried whether they would survive next year as a safe space for the LGBQ+ community in Colchester to go out at night.  After the Budget she is more confident."" ""It improves our chances in the longer term. I think it is a really good start for Rachel Reeves but I think we could do more"". So a photo opportunity at the Dragonfly Lounge for the Chancellor might find some raising their glasses to her.  But if growth drags, taxes bite into disposable incomes and customers sashay away from the night time economy Rachel Reeves may face a tough crowd here."
China US,The contradiction at the heart of the trillion-dollar AI race,2025-11-19T13:52:41.501Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvynlxqdyo,"But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. ""AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on,"" he insists. ""It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions."" But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a ""sudden correction"" in global financial markets, saying ""market valuations appear stretched"" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that ""there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now"". Asked whether from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us."" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these ""inflection points"": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. ""Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence."" But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is ""palpably exciting"" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: ""It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… ""So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: ""restricted"". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term ""AI factories"" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: ""I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!"" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: ""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough."" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. ""I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,"" he said. But he also said: ""What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure."" Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. ""I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,"" he told me. ""Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it."" But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: ""truth matters"". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? ""I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,"" he adds. ""I think that will have consequences."" Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about ""irrational exuberance"". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century."

China US,Cameroon's opposition leader in The Gambia after fleeing for his safety ,2025-11-24T11:26:59.659Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dyjn1mne5o,"Cameroonian opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who is contesting the outcome of the presidential election, has fled to The Gambia for his safety, The Gambian government has said. Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he is the legitimate winner of the 12 October election, alleging that the result was rigged to give President Paul Biya, 92, an eighth term. The Gambian information ministry said on Sunday that Tchiroma Bakary arrived on 7 November and was allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds. Cameroon's government had threatened to put him on trial for allegedly inciting violent post-election demonstrations. He denied the allegation, and blamed the security forces for a crackdown on protesters. The government put the number of people killed in post-election violence at 16, but other organisations have given a higher death toll. Tchiroma Bakary has repeatedly promised to resist Biya's government until his ""victory"" in the election is recognised. Biya, the world's oldest president, has been in power for 43 years, and was declared the winner with 53.7% of the vote amid allegations of fraud. Tchiroma Bakary, who served in Biya's government for many years, came second with 35.2%. His resistance tactics have included calling for street protests and ""ghost town"" operations aimed at bringing cities and towns to a standstill. Until The Gambian government confirmed his presence, his whereabouts had remained a mystery although there was speculation that he had fled to another country in the region. ""He is being hosted temporarily in The Gambia purely on humanitarian grounds in the spirit of African solidarity and for the purpose of ensuring his safety while discussions continue to pursue a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the post-electoral tensions in Cameroon,"" The Gambian government said in a statement. The Gambian authorities said the country would not be used as a ""base for subversive activity against any state"". The BBC has reached out to the Cameroonian government for comment. Reacting to the announcement, The Gambia's main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) criticised the government for withholding the announcement of Tchiroma Bakary's arrival until Sunday. It said it raised ""serious questions about transparency, accountability, and respect for The Gambian people's right to know what actions are taken in their name"". However, the party said it was proud that Tchiroma Bakary could find ""safe sanctuary"" in The Gambia, adding that it was fully aware of how ""despotism operates and how dissenters are treated""."

Some 1.4 million in the Philippines had been preemptively evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall on Sunday as a super typhoon, carrying winds of 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). It hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT) and weakened to a typhoon hours later. Fung-wong comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left nearly 200 people dead. Philippine authorities are reporting less severe damage than expected - though a number of communities are still cut off by the floods. By daybreak, the winds from Typhoon Fung-wong which had howled all night had died down, and people came out to see the damage. There was plenty of damage to buildings, but good preparation appears to have prevented a repeat of the casualties seen after Kalmaegi hit the central Philippines last week. The country's meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and ""high risk of life-threatening"" storm surges from the ""very intense"" typhoon. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, buildings were secured and residents in low-lying and coastal areas had been urged to move to higher ground. At a shelter in central Aurora, parents brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. ""We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,"" Jessa Zurbano had earlier told the BBC. Another evacuee Patry Azul said: ""Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe."" The winds Fung-wong brought were not as strong as in some previous storms, and its destructive power quickly weakened after it made landfall. Two deaths were reported, according to the civil defence office: one person drowned, while another woman was found dead under debris in Catbalogan City. Two others were injured. Still, many neighbourhoods have been flooded, and some are now isolated from the rest of the country after roads and bridges were cut by the high water levels. Aurora officials told local media on Monday that four towns have been blocked. Power is down in much of the main island of Luzon. The Filipino government had declared a state of calamity across the country in preparation for Typhoon Fung-wong and in the wake of Kalmaegi. This gives government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services. Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year, left at least 204 people dead in the Philippines, while more than 100 are missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones. About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide. However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - . That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding. Are you in the Philippines? If so you can"
China US,Why India caps pollution reading at 500 when the air is far more toxic,2025-11-16T00:00:03.510Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6jgg0180o,"For millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge. For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days. This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500? India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as ""severe"" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the So why was that threshold introduced? ""It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,"" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation. But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher. ""International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,"" says Mr Beig. ""That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms."" The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment. Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms. Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds. ""WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,"" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading. In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board. Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air. ""The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,""  says Mr Pathak, adding that ""sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government"". According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology. ""National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,"" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, ""now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase"". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling."
China US,Vicar leads push to honour Chinese WW1 labourers,2025-11-11T06:14:45.180Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04g2kz3rn6o,"A British-Chinese vicar is leading an effort to get the contribution of 140,000 Chinese labourers who helped the Allies in World War One formally remembered at St Paul's Cathedral. The Reverend Mark Nam, of St John the Evangelist in Woodley, Berkshire, first learned about the Chinese Labour Corps in an online talk during the Covid pandemic and needs £15,000 for the memorial. He said it was now his ""passion… so that my children's children see there were people like us, of Chinese heritage, who stood shoulder to shoulder with British troops at their hour of need"". The men were recruited from the Chinese province of Shandong to do manual work behind the frontlines from 1916. Mr Nam attended the online talk by the , which promotes Chinese culture with the aim of fostering better understanding between people of Chinese origin and those from other ethnic backgrounds, both in the UK and worldwide. ""As I started listening, oh my gosh, something was rising up in me,"" he said. ""I just didn't know about [the men]. By the end, I felt moved to action. ""A lot of people in this group are quite elderly. Hearing one gentleman say 'I hope I can see something established before I die' really touched me."" Having publicised the project online, he was approached by the cathedral and Mr Nam said an earmarked place for the memorial is an impressive spot. ""I thought it might be down a corridor, by the toilets or something,"" he said. ""It's within almost touching distance of Lord Nelson's tomb. It's great we have got the place. ""I suppose that is the easy bit. The hard bit is that I have to pay for it. ""I'm a parish priest, a vicar. I don't have money sloshing around in my cassock."" He is raising funds online to pay for the memorial, which he said would mark the men's contributions appropriately. ""I'm British-Chinese and Britain is my home and I want to see something on our shores,"" he added. ""France and Belgium have had memorials for several years and I would love to see Britain catch up and do this properly."""
China US,Our dogs' diversity can be traced back to the Stone Age,2025-11-13T19:00:29.556Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9d7j89ykro,"If you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable. But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought. ""When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,"" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study. She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago. In a paper , this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution. They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives. This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads. Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age. ""It's really surprising,"" she said. ""And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this."" Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle. This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication. Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food. Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near. As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: ""It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see. ""It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one."" For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In , a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China. They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years. I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back."
China US,Shock in Cameroon as 74-year-old opposition firebrand dies in detention,2025-12-01T17:38:50.481Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9204y4w5o,"Left-wing Cameroonian opposition figure Anicet Ekane has died in detention, five weeks after he was arrested, his lawyers and party have announced. Ekane, 74, was among the leaders of an opposition coalition who endorsed Issa Tchiroma Bakary in October's presidential election. Tchiroma Bakary says he was the rightful winner of the poll, officially won by 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya. . No official cause of Ekane's death has been announced. His party has accused the authorities of denying him access to his medication - a charge the government has denied. According to a spokesman for Ekane's African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Manidem) party, Ekane died on Monday morning at a military medical facility, after his health worsened over the weekend. ""We have no clarification... His wife had been called to come and when she found herself there, she was just presented the corpse of her husband,"" he said. He added that the family later took the corpse to the mortuary. Defence ministry spokesman Capt Cyrille Serge Atonfack said the Manidem leader had died from illness, but did not give any further details. ""The deceased, who suffered from various chronic pathologies, had been interned at the Military Medical Centre of the National Gendarmerie,"" he said, adding that the politician had been well taken care of by doctors since his arrest on 24 October. Minister of Communication and government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi later expressed the government's condolences to Ekane's family, as well as the Manidem party. He also said that Ekane had received proper medical attention from both his personal doctors and those at the military hospital where he was admitted, adding that an investigation had been launched to determine the exact circumstances of Ekane's death. Renowned anti-corruption lawyer Akere Muna described Ekane's death as ""the extinguishing of a fierce and passionate flame"" that burned for democratic emancipation. Muna said in a statement that Ekane had informed him of his ill-health during their last conversation. ""One would have thought that basic humanity, the fundamental presumption of innocence, and the undeniable evidence of his failing health would have compelled his release to his family and the care of the medical experts who knew his condition,"" Muna said. According to Ekane's lawyers, he was accused of hostility against the state, incitement to revolt, and calls for insurrection. ""He was never presented before a judge or charged with any misdemeanour,"" said one of his lawyers, Hippolyte Meli, in a statement on social media, describing the detention of the Manidem party leader as ""illegal"". In recent weeks, rumours had circulated that the opposition figure had died, and . His death has sent shockwaves across the nation, with supporters gathering at the party headquarters in Douala to grieve. Others have taken to venting their anger online. Manidem says its premises have been surrounded by security forces. Ekane initially endorsed another vibrant opposition figure, Maurice Kamto, for the presidential election. But Kamto, who endured a long detention after disputing the previous election in 2018, had his candidacy rejected upfront this time by both the electoral body, Elecam, and the Constitutional Council, on the grounds that the party had endorsed more than one candidate. Ekane and other politicians went on to create the Union for Change Coalition, which named former government spokesman Tchiroma Bakary as its candidate. At least 48 people were killed by Cameroon's security forces during protests against the re-election of President Biya, according to the UN. This included a number of people shot dead near Tchiroma Bakary's residence in the city of Garoua. He later claimed that snipers had been stationed at the house across from his, and were ""firing at point-blank range at the people"". The Cameroonian government has denied any wrongdoing."
China US,Google boss says trillion-dollar AI investment boom has 'elements of irrationality',2025-11-18T12:16:04.197Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo,"Every company would be affected if the AI bubble were to burst, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet has told the BBC. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an ""extraordinary moment"", there was some ""irrationality"" in the current AI boom. It comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry. Asked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning. ""I think no company is going to be immune, including us,"" he said. In a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment, , and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs. The interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense. Alphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI. A particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation. As valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment. It has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed. This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds. In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of ""irrational exuberance"" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can ""overshoot"" in investment cycles like this. ""We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,"" he said. ""I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."" His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry . But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own ""full stack"" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence. The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was , committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years. Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop ""state of the art"" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London. For the first time, he said Google would ""over time"" take a step that is being pushed for in government to ""train our models"" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI ""superpower"" after the US and China. ""We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,"" Mr Pichai said. However, he also warned about the ""immense"" energy needs of AI, which made up , according to the International Energy Agency. Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure. ""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,"" he said. He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies. ""The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,"" he said. AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it ""the most profound technology"" humankind had worked on. ""We will have to work through societal disruptions,"" he said, adding that it would also ""create new opportunities"". ""It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,"" he said. Those who do adapt to AI ""will do better"". ""It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools."" to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. ."
China US,From florist to drone maker: How the weapon became so mainstream,2025-11-14T22:24:18.224Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3ydv2ygro,"The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is often described as the world's ""first drone war"". It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements. Now, she makes drones for use against the Russians. ""It was just an obvious decision for me,"" she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. ""I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military."" Ms Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed. ""I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones,"" she recalled. ""So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them."" These days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon. Combat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact. Before 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones. ""This has been the first full-blown drone war,"" says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare. ""There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They've become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians."" And not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan. ""You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power."" Ms Pettyjohn says. The world's biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price has since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Europe, Portugal's Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany's Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is due in Swindon in southwest England at the end of November. Meanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would be on new military drones. ""The sector is growing really quickly,"" said Mike Armstrong, Stark's managing director for the UK. ""I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we've seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon."" The growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down. Anti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport. Oleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company. ""We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones,"" he says. Since 2022, DroneShield's share price has ""We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us,"" Mr Vornik adds. As well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China's use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs. Munin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army. ""We're building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones,"" he says. ""It's a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it's coming in."" Experts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI). At the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger. But Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. ""That is going to be the next real shift. ""Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate."" In the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line. ""I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course,"" she says. ""A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers. ""But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture."""
China US,Guinness maker appoints former Tesco boss to stem flagging sales,2025-11-10T13:53:50.155Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4021v7wepo,"A former Tesco boss has been appointed to the top job at Guinness-owner Diageo, as the biggest drinks firm in the world seeks to turn around its flagging sales. Sir Dave Lewis will take over the brewing giant on 1 January, after former chief executive Debra Crew quit in the summer after two years in charge. The firm has been battling weaker sales across its range despite a growth in Guinness sales, with shares recently falling to a 10-year low. Following the announcement of Sir Dave's appointment on Monday, Diageo's share price rose 7% in early trading. Diageo owns well-known brands including Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Captain Morgan rum, but has seen sales weakening in key markets, in particular the US and China. Sir Dave was chief executive of Tesco for six years until 2020, and before that had spent nearly 30 years at consumer goods giant Unilever. He will leave his current role as chairman of health firm Haleon. Diageo said its board felt Sir Dave had extensive chief executive experience and proven leadership skills ""that is right for Diageo at this time"". ""The market faces some headwinds but there are also significant opportunities,"" said Sir Dave. ""I look forward to working with the team to face these challenges and realise some of the opportunities in a way which creates shareholder value."" Diageo saw its operating profits decline to £3.2bn in the year to June - around 28% lower compared with the same period the year before - with net sales down 0.1%. It said there was ""clearly much more to do"" in what it called a challenging year, citing ""pressure on consumers"". Last week, Diageo forecast net sales growth would be flat to slightly down in the year ahead due to a ""weaker US consumer environment"" and lower sales across China. Rising inflation has led to people tightening their spending in recent times, with consumers cutting back on drinking and eating out. The firm has also been battling with changing drinking habits from younger people, who are opting to drink less alcohol than previous generations. ""Dave Lewis needs to put Diageo back on track quickly,"" said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. ""His style is to listen closely to customers and suppliers and work out what's gone wrong. The focus will be on repair work, not long-term growth."" Mr Coatsworth said the new boss earned the nicknam ""Drastic Dave"" while at Unilever ""because of his ability to make bold decisions without simply tinkering at the edges"". ""At Tesco, he walked away after saying his job to stabilise the business was done, rather than sticking around to take the business to the next level. One might suggest the same approach will apply to Diageo."" Sir Dave will replace Nik Jhangiani - Diageo's chief financial officer who has been acting as interim chief executive since Ms Crew resigned in July."
China US,Funeral company to move after business premises sold,2025-11-20T05:58:43.627Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx4xldplr4o,"A village's funeral director said he had been ""shocked"" after learning his leased premises had been sold without his knowledge. Richard Stebbings Funeral Service, which has operated in Impington, Cambridgeshire, for 21 years, has been purchased by a council-owned company. This Land, owned by Cambridge County Council, bought the family-run business alongside a village shop in the hope of building 28 apartments on the site. Mr Stebbings said the change ""just came as a shock"" and said he now does not ""know what to do or where to go"". This Land said it proposed to deliver a ""sustainable residential-led development"" to include 28 apartments, a retail unit, landscaping, and amenity space. A spokesperson for the business said: ""Discussions with the two current commercial tenants on the site remain ongoing and it is our aim to retain a productive dialogue with them as the plans for the site progress."" Mr Stebbings, who started working in the profession in 1966, said: ""We had a meeting and we thought we were still part of what was happening, but unfortunately we weren't. ""They said, 'I am afraid you are going to have to go' and I am just completely lost now."" This Land on Cambridgeshire County Council-owned land in 2016, but is yet to turn a profit. The authority has had to play down fears over about £120m it has loaned This Land. The business said it recognised ""the important role"" the funeral company had in the community and said it was ""committed to working closely with them as they explore options for the future of their businesses"". Mr Stebbings said he had received lots of support from his customers. ""Everything has to be done in a dignified way when you're caring for somebody's loved one - they need to be treated with respect."""
China US,Profits fall at IT firm Kainos despite rising revenue and global expansion,2025-11-10T11:00:19.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4zz47ew0o,"IT firm Kainos, one of Northern Ireland's largest businesses, has made £32m in pre-tax profit in the first half of the financial year. Although revenues rose to £196.1m, increased costs from national insurance rises, investments and temporary staffing reduced profits by 16% on the previous year. The company is set to take four floors of the £40m office building currently under construction at Bankmore Square as its new headquarters, due to open in September 2027. Kainos employs more than 3,100 people globally, offering digital services to large institutional clients like public bodies and the NHS, as well as finance and HR products in partnership with US firm Workday. AI is the hottest topic in both technology and financial markets, with the value of individual companies in the sector . Kainos CEO Brendan Mooney told BBC News NI that AI was already an important part of the company's own operations. ""That's everything from how we do our software engineering to how we are able to do prototyping for clients in ever quicker timeframes. Some 65% of what we do on the engineering side is now supported by AI tools and we see productivity improvements around that."" While a lot of tools for clients are still at the ""experimentation"" stage, some narrower AI tools have already been rolled out by the company, including a chat bot for Leeds City Council intended to provide guidance for those in financial distress. Other clients, dealing with sensitive data or live systems, are more hesitant. ""Some of our clients will be the likes of the Home Office, the Passport Service, the Ministry of Defence. Some clients, I think rightfully, are cautious about - you give the model your data, there's no guarantee you get it back or it doesn't go somewhere else."" Forty-three percent of the company's half year revenue came from its international operations, with 120 new employees in Canada and entry to new markets in Australia and New Zealand. Brendan Mooney said that trend is likely to continue. ""At our current pace, in two years' time, the majority of our business will be generated elsewhere – even while our UK business grows as well. The opportunities are global for what we do."" Another key growth area for the company is in the health care sector. Revenues from the health sector increased by 33% to £29.6m with the company providing services to research bodies, as well as the NHS. With the Chancellor announcing as one of her priorities ahead of the Autumn Statement, there is likely to be an increased focus on boosting productivity and digital accessibility in the health service."
China US,At least 65 dead and hundreds missing after fire engulfs Hong Kong tower blocks,2025-11-27T12:52:42.992Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg165d7ppvo,"At least 65 people have been killed in a huge fire that engulfed multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong - the city's deadliest blaze in more than 70 years. Some residents remain trapped inside the buildings, with more than 270 people unaccounted for, while 70 people are injured. Hundreds of firefighters have been tackling the blaze, which is now largely under control at all of the affected buildings at Wang Fuk Court. The housing complex had been undergoing extensive renovations when the fire began. The exact cause is unclear but police say materials on outside of the buildings may have facilitated its spread. Three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence. The blaze broke out at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, with flames and thick clouds of grey smoke seen billowing from the towers, dominating the city's skyline. By 18:22 local time, officials upgraded the fire to a level five - the most serious category. Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among those killed in the blaze. He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost. Ten other firefighters are also injured, according to the fire department. ""I am devastated,"" 65-year-old Jason Kong told news agency Reuters. ""I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do."" He said a neighbour had called him and said he was still trapped inside one of the tower blocks. The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris and the risk posed from collapsing scaffolding, has hampered rescue efforts, but the fire department has so far rescued 55 people. ""Despite the complex conditions at the scene, the firefighters' rescue efforts will not stop,"" Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee told a news conference on Thursday evening. Mesh material and plastic sheets which were found on the outside of the buildings are not believed to be fireproof, while Styrofoam was also found on the buildings' windows. These materials may have allowed the fire to spread faster, police said. ""We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,"" a police spokesperson said. Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption has said it will launch a criminal investigation over the renovation works. Fire safety expert Prof Jiang Liming, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said he believed the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks may have also helped the fire grow. Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight across Hong Kong - a city known for its high-rise buildings - and is widely used in construction. Lee said he had arranged inspections of ""all housing estates undergoing major repairs"" to check the ""safety of scaffolding and building materials"". He added that the government was considering a review of bamboo scaffolding and whether they should be replaced by metal frameworks. ""The government will stand united with all Hong Kong people, and we are confident that we will be able to get through this together,"" he said. Campaigning for the city's Legislative Council election on 7 December has been suspended. Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po district was built in 1983 and consists of eight tower blocks providing 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built. Some residents told local media that alarms did not sound when the fire began, and that they struggled to leave when the elevators stopped working. Kiko Ma, 33, who has an apartment in the housing complex, told the BBC that some of the fire alarms had been turned off during the renovation, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to enter and exit the buildings. There were also reports on Wednesday night of blasts being heard from inside the buildings, and of fire hoses struggling to reach the upper levels of the 31-storey towers. Police have evacuated nearby buildings, and several temporary shelters have been opened. One of the shelters, located across the road from the housing complex, was deemed unsafe as the fire raged, and evacuees were directed to another further away. Outside one of the shelters, a woman was seen holding her daughter's graduation photo as she searched for her family. ""She and her father are still not out yet,"" the 52-year-old told Reuters. ""They didn't have water to save our building."" An officer at a temporary shelter earlier told news agency AFP that it was unclear how many people were unaccounted for because residents were still trickling in late into the night to report missing family members. As dawn broke on Thursday morning, small fires remained visible from the outside of the still-smouldering buildings. Meanwhile, people have been turning up with food and clothes for displaced residents. Several well-known Chinese businesses have pledged donations to support relief efforts. Alibaba Group, which owns e-commerce platforms Temu and Taobao, said it would give HK$20 million ($2.6m; £1.9m). There is a large evacuation zone around the fire, roads are closed and more than 30 bus routes have been diverted, Hong Kong's Transport Department says. Thirteen nearby schools have suspended lessons, education officials said. China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported. Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record happened in 1948, which killed 176 people and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse."
China US,Mick Jagger makes surprise visit to his old school,2025-11-19T18:36:55.535Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3k3wejkkvo,"Sir Mick Jagger has advised the next generation of musicians to ""work really hard and not give up"" during a surprise visit to his former school. The Rolling Stones frontman visited The Mick Jagger Centre at Dartford Grammar School in Kent on Wednesday to mark the facility's 25th anniversary. The 82-year-old thanked music teachers at the performing arts centre who ""inspired children and young people in their musical careers"". Sir Mick told the BBC that young people aiming for a music career needed ""a lot of luck"" and to ""work really hard at it and not give up"". He said that ""music wasn't much of a career"" when he was growing up, but added: ""That all changed very, very quickly in the early 60s and I got on that bandwagon."" He opened The Mick Jagger Centre, home to the Dartford Music School and Dartford Symphony Orchestra, in 2000. The centre launched a programme of events in October to mark its 25th anniversary. Sir Mick said that visiting his former school ""brings back a lot of memories and it's nice to see the kids seem happy"". According to The Mick Jagger Centre, the singer funds its Red Rooster project offering free music tuition, including in local primary schools. ""If you can express yourself through song, drama, art, dance – all these things are important,"" Sir Mick added. ""My involvement's been honestly pretty minimal in a real way, but I do feel connected to it, and I think all the people involved with it have done a really wonderful job."" The school's headmaster, Julian Metcalf, said Sir Mick's return visit was ""very special and the icing on the cake"". ""He completely proved wrong that old adage that you should never meet your heroes. What a genuinely lovely guy,"" he told BBC Radio Kent. Mr Metcalf said Sir Mick watched a pupil concert - which ""he loved"" - and later performed on stage with students. ""It was unbelievable to watch,"" said the headteacher. ""You can take the boy out of Dartford, but you can never take the Dartford out of the boy. He has kept a real interest in Kent, Dartford and what is going on in the school."" Sir Mick first met The Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards on a platform at Dartford station, forming a friendship that would lead to the band's formation in 1962. The town has several streets named after The Rolling Stones songs, including Little Red Walk, Angie Mews and Ruby Tuesday Drive."
China US,Text scammers make tens of thousands a month - and spend it on designer shoes and bags ,2025-11-29T05:01:03.557Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4nzp6ezg7o,"""They don't keep money, they spend it here and now."" Det Ch Insp Paul Curtis is showing us around an evidence room piled high with designer shoes and handbags. Thousands of items are neatly stacked in plastic containers on wooden shelves. The items here have been seized from financial fraudsters, some of whom send scam texts - known as smishing - to victims. ""They like to live a lavish lifestyle,"" says Curtis. ""We have got somewhere between 8,500 and 10,000 items of evidence in this one room,"" he says, something that is ""the result of house searches and raids"" carried out by officers. The smell of fresh leather goods pervades the air. Brightly coloured Gucci stilettos catch the eye from a distance; it's a treasure trove of top-label kit worth tens of thousands of pounds. These purchases are an indication of how much cash they're making from their crimes and what they're spending it on. The term ""smishing"" is a combination of ""SMS"", or ""short message service"" - the technology behind text messages - and ""phishing"". Fraudsters send fake text messages - apparently from a bank or other trusted company - to trick people into disclosing personal information such as passwords and Pin numbers. The intention is to defraud them out of their money. Curtis is part of the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit - a team made up of officers from the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police service. Although they're London police forces, the unit has a national remit, and is sponsored by the banking industry. It focuses on combating financial fraud. ""In a recent smishing case of ours, the defendant was sentenced on the basis of sending 15,000 messages in a five day period. That equated to making a hundred thousand pounds a month,"" he says. The senior officer was talking about Ruichen Xiong, a student from China who was convicted of the crime after driving around London in March of this year, sending messages to tens of thousands of potential victims. Xiong was sentenced in June at Inner London Crown Court to 58 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to fraud by representation. According to Ofcom, half of UK mobile users said they received a suspicious message between November 2024 and February 2025 via text or iMessage. Gideon Rabinowitz, 64, lives in Newbury, Berkshire, and is a recent victim of smishing. Just two months ago, the former IT manager said he was cheated out of more than a thousand pounds after receiving a fraudulent text message. ""I felt like a massive fool, like I'd been violated,"" he says. ""It really shook me. For a number of days after it really left me quite shaken. I felt very vulnerable and I don't know who to trust now."" Mr Rabinowitz was led to believe he was being contacted by his bank who were reporting a suspicious payment on his account. In reality, he was being messaged by a scammer. ""It started with a text out of the blue asking if I recognised a transaction - yes or no. Two and half hours later I was out of pocket by £1400."" He adds: ""In part it was about the money and it was also this feeling of being defrauded, of being looked up, because these people knew who I was. They knew where I live"". Scam text messages often pretend to be from large companies such as utility companies, banks or supermarkets. They usually include a link. Once the person clicks on it, they can be sent to a fraudulent website and asked for personal and financial information. The information can then be used to convince them to transfer money from their account. Smishing is primarily done through two devices; a Sim farm which holds multiple Sim cards, allowing criminals to bombard people with thousands of scam texts. The second is what's called an SMS Blaster. It tricks mobiles nearby into connecting with it, and then sends large numbers of fraudulent texts in a matter of seconds. The government says ""smishing scams have a devastating impact on their victims"". ""Our Telecoms Charter sets out clear action to secure SMS and reduce fraud across the telecoms sector"". ""We are also banning Sim farms. Banning these devices used to send thousands of scam texts will close down a key tool for criminals and safeguard consumers,"" it says. The ban is expected to come into effect late next year. It will make the possession or supply of Sim farms, without a specified reason, illegal. One cyber expert said smishing was a difficult crime to solve and that there needs to be more education around fraudulent text messages. ""Smishing in and of itself is very hard to police because a lot of it comes from abroad and, even when it's done from within the UK it's very easy to do and hard to trace, "" says Ciaran Martin, the former Chief Executive of the National Cyber Security Centre. ""So while the police can sometimes take down big operations, we shouldn't look to the police as the strategic answer for this. ""The strategic answer is for people to understand that serious businesses don't ask you for money by text, and for businesses to find better ways of interacting with customers and verifying that interaction"". The advice from police is simple: do not click on the links in any unsolicited messages you receive. If you believe you're a victim of fraud, report to Action Fraud, report to your bank, and forward the message to 7726 so the mobile networks can investigate further."
China US,AI firm claims Chinese spies used its tech to automate cyber attacks,2025-11-14T12:16:51.557Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lzmygr84o,"The makers of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Claude claim to have caught hackers sponsored by the Chinese government using the tool to perform automated cyber attacks against around 30 global organisations. Anthropic said hackers tricked the chatbot into carrying out automated tasks under the guise of carrying out cyber security research. The company this was the ""first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign"". But sceptics are questioning the accuracy of that claim - and the motive behind it. Anthropic said it discovered the hacking attempts in mid-September. Pretending they were legitimate cyber security workers, hackers gave the chatbot small automated tasks which, when strung together, formed a ""highly sophisticated espionage campaign"". Researchers at Anthropic said they had ""high confidence"" the people carrying out the attacks were ""a Chinese state-sponsored group"". They said humans chose the targets - large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies – but the company would not be more specific. Hackers then built an unspecified programme using Claude's coding assistance to ""autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement"". Anthropic claims the chatbot was able to successfully breach various unnamed organisations, extract sensitive data and sort through it for valuable information. The company said it had since banned the hackers from using the chatbot and had notified affected companies and law enforcement. But Martin Zugec from cyber firm Bitdefender said the cyber security world had mixed feelings about the news. ""Anthropic's report makes bold, speculative claims but doesn't supply verifiable threat intelligence evidence,"" he said. ""Whilst the report does highlight a growing area of concern, it's important for us to be given as much information as possible about how these attacks happen so that we can assess and define the true danger of AI attacks."" Anthropic's announcement is perhaps the most high profile example of companies claiming bad actors are using AI tools to carry out automated hacks. It is the kind of danger many have been worried about, but other AI companies have also claimed that nation state hackers have used their products. In February 2024, OpenAI published a blog post in collaboration with cyber experts from Microsoft saying it had disrupted five state-affiliated actors, including some from China. ""These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,"" . Anthropic has not said how it concluded the hackers in this latest campaign were linked to the Chinese government. The Chinese embassy in the US told reporters it was not involved. It comes as some cyber security companies have been criticised for over-hyping cases where AI was used by hackers. Critics say the technology is still too unwieldy to be used for automated cyber attacks. In November, cyber experts at Google which highlighted growing concerns about AI being used by hackers to create brand new forms of malicious software. But the paper concluded the tools were not all that successful - and were only in a testing phase. The cyber security industry, like the AI business, is keen to say hackers are using the tech to target companies in order to boost the interest in their own products. In its blog post, Anthropic argued that the answer to stopping AI attackers is to use AI defenders. ""The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defence,"" the company claimed. And Anthropic admitted its chatbot made mistakes. For example, it made up fake login usernames and passwords and claimed to have extracted secret information which was in fact publicly available. ""This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,"" Anthropic said. to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. ."
China US,"Russian spy ship pointed lasers at RAF pilots tracking it, says UK",2025-11-19T19:07:00.819Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24028k7edo,"A Russian spy ship has used lasers for the first time to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters, the defence secretary has said. John Healey told reporters the ""deeply dangerous"" move from the Yantar was being taken ""extremely seriously"" by the government. He added that the vessel was north of Scotland and had entered UK waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks. The UK would continue monitoring the ship and had ""military options ready should the Yantar change course,"" he added. ""My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,"" he added. Healey said the laser incident took place whilst the Yantar was being followed by a Royal Navy frigate and RAF Poseidon P-8 planes deployed to ""track the vessel's every move"". It is understood the episode occurred within the last two weeks. Speaking at a news conference in Downing Street, the defence secretary added he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely ""when it is in our wider waters"". Healey said the vessel, which entered service in 2015, was part of Russia's Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), which was designed to ""undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict"". ""We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,"" he said. Asked about the risks posed by lasers, Healey replied: ""Anything that impedes, disrupts or puts at risk pilots in charge of British military planes is deeply dangerous."" The Russian Embassy released a statement, saying it was ""not interested in British underwater communications"". ""The actions of our country do not touch interests of the UK and they are not aimed at undermining its security,"" the statement said. It added: ""However, London, with its Russophobic path and increasing militaristic hysteria leads to further degradation European security, providing the premise for new dangerous situations. ""We call on the British side to hold off taking any destructive steps which might aggravate the crisis situation on the European continent."" Labour MP Matt Western, who chairs the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, said: ""Today's news demonstrates once again that Russia presents a genuine and immediate threat to the UK's security."" He added: ""I welcome the seriousness with which the defence secretary is treating this issue, but there is more we can do. More assertive retaliation may be required."" The defence secretary previously about the Yantar after it was spotted in UK waters in January, calling it ""another example of growing Russian aggression"". According to the ship tracking website Marine Traffic, the ship has not broadcast its location since 2 November, and was last tracked in the Baltic Sea north of the Latvian Coast. On 6 November, the Dutch Navy said two of its vessels escorted the Yantar out of the North Sea, where it was operating near Dutch territorial waters. While the Yantar's current position is not clear, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows an RAF Poseidon P-8 surveillance plane circling off the Scottish coast, although it is not certain that this is tracking the Yantar. Russia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables. Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American security think tank, said the Yantar's use of lasers was ""an escalation for sure"". ""Essentially, you do it to impede the pilots from doing their work,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""We don't know exactly how strong the lasers were, but even if they didn't blind the pilots, it was provocative,"" she added. The UK and its Nato allies are to offshore cables, pipelines and other infrastructure critical to internet connectivity. In his speech, the defence secretary warned about Russian incursions into Nato airspace, as well as the threats posed by China and armed conflicts around the world, adding: ""Our world is changing. It is less predictable. It is more dangerous."" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has come under for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack. The committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal. Healey said the UK government ""takes a different view"" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato. But he said the committee was ""right to say"" Britain should ""pick up the pace of our commitment"" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year. The report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme . The Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month. Healey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not ""at any price"", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part. It has been reported that the EU is demanding an entry fee running to billions of euros before the UK can take part. He added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be ""good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry""."
China US,"'I worked, I paid taxes - then the bank took my home'",2025-11-19T03:39:23.284Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jz321x14o,"""I am waiting for the bailiff to knock on the door, take my keys and kick me out,"" says Jose Da Costa Diogo, one of thousands of people who have been told this year their homes will be repossessed. The 65-year-old learned he would lose his home in Thetford, Norfolk, during a brisk 10-minute county court hearing earlier this year. The interest-only mortgage on the three-bedroom property was taken out more than 20 years ago in the hope he and his then wife would save up enough to eventually cover the capital sum. But the collapse of the marriage and his ex-wife's departure to Brazil in 2015, left Mr Da Costa Diogo unable to repay the £80,000 still outstanding. And because his ex-wife was still on both the mortgage documents and the property deeds, he was also unable to sell the property to cover the outstanding amount. ""I tried to do the right thing and carried on paying all the bills,"" he said. ""After 25 years, I have nothing to show... but I still have to carry on living. ""I'm going to be homeless."" Court figures - the highest number in five years. Experts say the rise is down to a variety of factors and the rise in the general cost of living. Mr Da Costa Diogo registered as homeless with Breckland Council, his local authority. He is far from alone. The BBC asked every English council with housing responsibilities how many people presented as homeless as a result of a mortgage repossession. The number has doubled, according to the 240 councils that provided comparable data - from 1,517 in 2022-23, to 2,370 in 2023-24. It was 3,406 in the most recent year. People in local government say rehoming those affected by repossessions is putting ever greater stress on council resources. Tom Hunt, who chairs the Local Government Association's Inclusive Growth Board, said: ""As more and more people turn to their council for help, local authorities are having to stretch budgets further. ""The temporary accommodation crisis facing councils is only worsening."" Lucy Davies sees the devastation repossessions can have on a daily basis. A housing law advisor with the Suffolk Law Centre, she volunteers her expertise to those in need at courts in Suffolk and Essex. ""I see the sheer number of people that this is affecting,"" said Ms Davies. ""People get into difficulties largely through no fault of their own. ""Quite often there's mental health, there's employment issues, there's family issues, and I think it can very quickly spiral out of control."" On the day the BBC joined Ms Davies for a day at Ipswich County Court, where she volunteers with the Ipswich County Court Advice and Representation Service, none of the five people facing mortgage repossession cases turned up. This, she said, was often a symptom of shame, despair and the sense that losing one's home is a foregone conclusion. ""It is quite frightening coming to court, but it doesn't have to be."" She urged people to seek advice as soon as possible and said the cases she was seeing were becoming ""more entrenched or more serious"". People were finding it increasingly difficult to access housing legal aid, she explained. Paul Gorton, of The Law Society's housing law committee, agreed. He said a historic lack of investment in legal aid meant fewer and fewer law firms were able to offer legal aid housing advice. ""Many people are too well off to be eligible for legal aid but cannot afford to pay for legal advice themselves,"" Mr Gorton said. ""We have both legal aid provider deserts and restrictive eligibility criteria leaving many people stuck in limbo."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it had recently announced ""the first major funding increase for housing legal aid in three decades - a 24% rise"". ""This investment will help ensure effective access to justice for some of the most vulnerable in our society, while supporting a more stable and sustainable legal aid sector,"" the spokesperson said. Seeking to repossess a home is ""always a last resort"" for lenders, said Karina Hutchins, a principal in the mortgage policy team at UK Finance, a trade association for the banking and financial services sector. She said while the number of mortgage repossessions had been creeping up in recent years, the current levels remained ""historically low"". ""Repossessions are really, really uncommon."" She said in the first quarter of 2025, about 2,000 homes were repossessed compared with 13,000 in the same quarter of 2009, in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. ""I can imagine that customers are really worried and distressed if they're facing financial difficulty, but they don't have to go through it alone,"" Ms Hutchins said. ""The earlier they get in touch with their mortgage lender, the more support and help that that lender can give them and the more likelihood they have of getting back up to date with their mortgage."" Options offered by lenders, she said, included reduced mortgage payments to allow time to get back on track, budgeting and other tools to understand ""their full financial situation"" and advice about debt charities and support organisations. Henry Sabati McRae, who lives in Croydon, south London, has so far managed to stave off repossession. A software developer by training, Mr McRae's financial woes came in the wake of the death of a brother in 2020 and his mother in October 2023. Since October 2024, the 51-year-old has been out of work and, despite applying for hundreds of jobs, he has not managed to get a new contract. ""It doesn't matter how much you have in savings,"" he said. ""Within a few months it is wiped out. I managed to stretch it as far as I could, because I'd been quite conservative with how I was doing."" Even so, the mortgage arrears on his two-bedroom flat eventually grew to about £13,000 and his bank said if that figure was not reduced to below £8,000 it would seek to repossess his home. ""The most important thing for me at that time, and I think for anybody, was keeping the roof over my head,"" he said. ""Otherwise it spirals out of control."" To scrape by, he has turned to selling off his possessions on an internet auction site and accepting a loan from a friend. Like many of those facing repossession action the BBC has spoken to, Mr McRae said the experience was deeply ""humiliating"" and that his instincts were initially ""to draw the curtains shut"". However, he said realising he was far from alone and in speaking about it has helped him plot out, like an IT problem, his ""solution to it"". Businessman Mike Williams, who lives 10 miles (16km) south of Mr McRae in Caterham, Surrey, has also avoided repossession. He took on the mortgage of his self-build home after he and his wife separated. In three years, repayments on the interest-only loan, which was taken out 20 years ago, have tripled. He says it has left him with ""next to no disposable income"". At court, he renegotiated a repayment plan which would add an extra 20% to his monthly payments. In five years, when the mortgage comes to term, he intends to sell the two-bedroom house which he and his wife built from the ground up. ""It has quite a bit of sentimental value to me, so yes it is heart-wrenching,"" he said. As for Mr Da Costa Diogo, his bank has repossessed the property. In the same month it was repossessed, the BBC saw a similar three-bedroom property in the same Thetford street as Mr Da Costa Diogo's on the market for £160,000 - almost double the amount he owed. Within hours of losing his home, he was given emergency accommodation in a small ground-floor studio in north Suffolk. ""I left my house with one suitcase and a bag of essentials and told the council 'I'm homeless'. ""It's a roof over my head. I'm trying to keep things simple because what is the point of complicating things? ""I'm alive and I carry on."" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day."

Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt. ""I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,"" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin. This is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet""; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports. After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance. Some ""shadow"" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or ""spoofing"" their location data. Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of ""shadow"" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically ""floating rust buckets"", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, ""good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost"". Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: ""There's no secret made about it."" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as ""false"". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called , but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection. Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point ""where they just don't even bother at all"", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages. Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air that ""shadow"" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. While politicians , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea. The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it. Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event. ""There's a complexity associated with it,"" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. ""With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis."" The Estonians speak from experience. When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has ""constantly"" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk. The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken. ""Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,"" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, ""we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself"". ""Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies."" Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up. ""Thank you for your co-operation,"" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia. The exchange lasted just over five minutes. ""You need to see it in a larger perspective,"" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: ""This information can be used in our maritime surveillance."" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: ""You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels."" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile ""the dark fleet is getting darker"". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's ""anti-Russian sanctions"" were ""illegitimate"" and ""undermine established principles of global commerce"". ""Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,"" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to ""easily resolved"" issues such as administrative delays. It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had ""heightened"" the risks by ""forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape""."
China US,How a 'fertility gap' is fuelling the rise of one-child families,2025-12-05T14:39:45.809Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyv7211jljo,"""It was nice to hear someone giving it a name,"" she says. She and her husband have a five-year-old daughter called Joanie but they knew they probably wouldn't have a second child - not because they couldn't, but not out of choice, either: Natalie finds it hard to imagine having the time and money for one. ""You know you'd love that baby, everyone tells you, but there's a little teeny niggle where you think, 'what if I put my first in that position where she can't do the activity she wants to do because I've got to spread money out between two'?"" She adds: ""Is it okay to say you're only having one because they don't fit into modern ways of parenting?"" Modern parenting, for Natalie, 35, looks like family holidays with Joanie. It looks like weekday evenings hearing about her day at school and helping her with homework. But, with demanding jobs and no family living nearby to help with childcare, it also looks like an expensive childcare jigsaw. But ultimately, deciding whether or not to have a second is a tough decision. ""I think you worry you'd regret it,"" she says. The fertility rate was 1.41 children per woman in England and Wales last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest on record for a third year running. Separately, the proportion of families with one dependent child has grown since the turn of the century - that includes families with one child, as well as those who also have children over 18 or may have left home. They made up 44% of all families in England and Wales with dependent children living with them, up from 42% in 2000. (Though the peak was 47% in the early 2010s, which then dipped before picking up again after Covid.) The UK's falling birth rate is part of what the United Nations calls a ""global fertility slump"", which it puts down, in part, to money worries. People aren't ""turning their backs on parenthood"", says the UN in a summary of its Population Fund's State of World Population report, which surveyed people across 14 countries. Instead it says they ""are being denied the freedom to start families due to skyrocketing living costs, persistent gender inequality and deepening uncertainty about the future"". Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said earlier this year that she wants ""more young people to have children, if they so choose"". She pointed to the expansion of funded childcare hours in England as a way the government was trying to recover ""dashed dreams"". Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England did fall this year for the first time in 15 years, . They are now an average of £12,425, down 22% on the previous year. However they are slightly up in Scotland and Wales, at £12,468 and £15,038 respectively. A study from University College London (UCL) last year suggested two-fifths of 32-year-olds in England want children – or more children, if they are already parents – but only one in four of them are actively trying to conceive. Dr Paula Sheppard, an anthropologist at the University of Oxford, believes parents in the West still think of having two children as ""the norm"". However, she says there is a ""fertility gap"" and that ""for every three kids wanted… only two are born"". ""A lot of this gap is driven by… people starting families later and later in life,"" she explains – often a result of education and career opportunities for women and changing gender roles. ""It becomes a whole lot more difficult to get pregnant [and] it becomes a whole lot more difficult to keep the pregnancy."" The falling birthrate is giving education policymakers a headache. The number of pupils in England has dropped by 150,000 since 2019, and will fall by a further 400,000 by the end of the decade, according to the Education Policy Institute. Schools are given money per pupil, so fewer pupils means less cash. Less cash, in turn, is an issue for those head teachers struggling to fund staffing and resources. About a year ago, a post on a UK Reddit thread for teachers raised what one contributor saw as another potential impact of more only children on the education system. The contributor wrote that they had seen a rise in ""spoilt"" children with ""demanding behaviour due to overindulgent parenting"". These children tended to have siblings who were much older or no siblings at all, they claimed. The idea that children without siblings may be selfish or spoiled dates back to research conducted in the late 19th century by psychologists G Stanley Hall and E W Bohannon. ""Selfishness is one of the most striking traits of the only children in families,"" they wrote in their Study of Peculiar and Exceptional Children. ""'The only child' is deficient on the social side."" But more recent studies have debunked that idea. ""Numerous studies have disproven these myths that only children are maladjusted, spoiled, and lonely,"" explains Dr Adriean Mancillas, a psychologist and professor in California State University's education department. Dr Mancillas has spent her career exploring family dynamics, the development of only children, and mental health intervention in schools - and says most research ""consistently demonstrates advantages of being an only child, particularly in educational and academic outcomes"". This is down, mainly, to a theory called ""resource dilution"". In simple terms, she says this means parents with one child ""are able to be more involved in their child's education"". ""Children with siblings share in parents' time, emotional support, attention, and financial resources whereas the only child does not,"" says Dr Mancillas. ""This singular focus of resources tends to provide academic advantages for the only child."" She points to some research that suggests many only children did better academically when schools closed to most pupils in lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, ""because of the relative availability of parental resources"". ""Resource dilution"" is one of three social science theories about the consequences of being an only child, according to University College London (UCL) academics. The second is ""confluence theory"", which also suggests that only children perform better than children with siblings academically because a family's ""intellectual environment"" declines as the number of children grows. Then there is ""socialisation theory"" which, in contrast, argues that siblings help children learn how to share, negotiate and resolve conflict. Existing research, according to the UCL academics, support the first two theories. But, like Dr Mancillas, they say it ""generally does not support the socialisation theory as it finds that only children are comparable to children with siblings (especially those with few siblings) in terms of personality, parent-child relationships, achievement, motivation and personal adjustment"". Dr Mancillas suggests there could be something else feeding into only children's better academic performance, too. ""Studies show that parents with one child tend to have attained higher educational outcomes themselves than parents of multiple children,"" she says. ""Much of the time, parents have delayed having children in order to complete career or higher educational goals. This would suggest that parents who have one child likely place a high value on education overall."" Earlier this year, Susan Newman, an American psychologist explored so-called only-child dynasties - where parents who are only-children, have one child themselves - in an article to accompany her new book, Just One: The New Science, Secrets & Joy of Parenting an Only Child. One of the most surprising findings from the new research for her book was, she wrote: ""Adult only-children are increasingly choosing to have ""just one"" child themselves. ""The resulting only-child dynasties underscore the trend. Count on seeing more of them, most noticeably without the spoiled, entitled 'little emperors' we heard so much about for so long -despite a lack of evidence to support such misinformed stereotypes."" The phrase has been used as shorthand to describe the only children born under China's one-child policy, the idea held by some being that it led to a generation of ""solitary children pampered and paraded with a retinue of parents and elders"". However, while the policy did leave a lasting legacy after its end in 2015 - an ageing population, for example, and a gender imbalance because of a traditional preference for male children - research has suggested that the ""little emperor effect"" has not been a part of it. There were ""very few only-child effects"" on children's personality, according to a study of Chinese schoolchildren carried out by American researchers at two Texas Universities. The phrase ""one and done"" was only just beginning to emerge when New York-based journalist Lauren Sandler began writing her 2013 book, One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One. ""I would be on the subway with my adorable child and someone would say, 'so cute, when are you having another one?' ""There is so little discussion about what it means to have single children, which is incredible to me considering how many there are."" She adds: ""I think that people feel very alone in this."" She began to question why some people assumed she would want more children, something she also explored for her work. It used to be that having larger families was how we survived, she points out. ""A family was a workforce, and that was very much a necessity until the industrial revolution."" Only after the industrial revolution, and the introduction of child labour and welfare laws did that change. ""The opportunity costs and the economic costs of children shifted dramatically,"" she explains. She also questioned the negative connotations that can sometimes be associated with having one child. ""There's also a lot of research that shows that only children do not take relationships for granted at a very, very young age. So, [it's not the same as when you] fight with your older brother and then just, through exposure, need to make up again. ""These people aren't going to be at the dinner table with you every night. Because of that, there's a lot of care that seems to come into relationships. And so that is sort of the opposite of the selfish stereotype of only children."" So teachers may not really have a generation of ""little emperors"" on their hands. But the is still very much being felt by some schools, and more widely too. Policymakers, for example, are grappling with the impact of the UK's ageing population on public services, taxes, and the growing cost of state pensions. ""Falling birth rates and an ageing population can create pressures on public services and public finances because the balance between the number of people working and the number of people drawing on age-related services changes over time,"" says Dr Alina Pelikh of University College London, who specialises in demography. ""Governments may need to consider adjustments - whether through pension age, contributions, or other measures - to ensure long-term sustainability."" The concerns are global, and governments around the world are trying to encourage people to have more children. US President Donald Trump has mentioned the idea of a $5,000 ""baby bonus"". Poland has just introduced a policy of zero personal income tax for families with two or more children. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has introduced tax exemptions for mothers. But for all the the statistics and policymaking this is, ultimately, a very personal decision. Natalie couldn't be prouder of her daughter, who has recently been made ""values ambassador"" in her class, encouraging other children to show empathy and respect. ""She has been chosen, not because she's an only child, because they don't know whether she's got siblings or not. She's been chosen based on her personality,"" says Natalie. ""I don't think I was ever worried about not giving her [a sibling], because you can never have a child for somebody else. ""You've got to have a child for yourself, haven't you?"""
China US,US calls for international action to cut weapons supply to Sudan paramilitaries,2025-11-14T08:20:20.531Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17p1nwy7q8o,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are accused of mass killings in el-Fasher. At the end of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada, Rubio said the RSF had committed systematic atrocities, including murder, rape and sexual violence against civilians. Sudan's army accuses the United Arab Emirates of propping up the RSF with weapons and mercenaries sent via African nations. The UAE and the RSF have repeatedly denied these allegations. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into all-out civil war. Rubio's comments are some of the most outspoken so far by the Trump administration about the war in Sudan and the actions of the RSF, but it is not clear how much impact they will have. A previous US-backed proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan has already been violated by the RSF, even though they agreed to it last week. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF after an 18-month siege, meaning they now control all of the cities in the vast western Darfur region. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee the city, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Non-Arab groups in the wider Darfur region are being systematically targeted by the RSF in what amounts to genocide, according to the US and humanitarian groups. At the talks near Niagara Falls on Wednesday, America's top diplomat said women and children had been targeted in acts of the most horrific kind by the RSF in el-Fasher. Rubio told reporters: ""They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind.  And it needs to end immediately. ""And we're going to do everything we can to bring it to an end, and we've encouraged partner nations to join us in this fight."" However, Rubio stopped short of publicly criticising Abu Dhabi, in spite of evidence that the Gulf state is the RSF's main arms supplier, presented in investigations by the international media that the UN has found credible. The Trump administration is working for an end to the war together with the UAE, as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who are allies of Sudan's military-led government, collectively known as the ""Quad"". ""I don't want to get into calling anybody out at a press conference today, because what we want is a good outcome here,"" Rubio said on Wednesday, but added pointedly: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" In September, the Quad jointly proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. In a statement on Thursday, the UAE expressed ""alarm at the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in El Fasher"". It went on to accuse the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusations the army has previously denied. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. The secretary of state rejected the paramilitary group's attempt to blame the killings on rogue elements, saying this was false and the attacks were systematic. Asked by the BBC about his assessment of the likely scale of atrocities, he said the US feared that thousands of people who had been expected to flee el-Fasher were either dead or too malnourished to move. He said the RSF, lacking its own arms manufacturing facilities, relied on outside support, and called for countries supplying weapons to stop. In response the RSF issued a lengthy statement denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"". The paramilitary group repeated denials that it does not receive support from external parties and said it did not accept attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. ""The party that has rejected all ceasefire initiatives and refused to engage in them is the army affiliated with the terrorist Islamic Movement,"" it said, ""while our forces responded in good faith officially announcing their approval. Yet to this day we have not received any reply from the US side. So, where is the other party and where is its response?"" The joint G7 statement also condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". To date, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes. The flow of weapons into the country during this two-year-long civil war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups."
China US,Elon Musk's $1tn pay deal approved by Tesla shareholders,2025-11-07T10:03:09.647Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyk6kvyxvzo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders. The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday. Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares. The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him. Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name. ""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" he said. ""Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,"" he added. The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include: He won't receive a salary under the agreed deal. But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm's market value is raised high enough. Musk's early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an ""autonomous humanoid robot"" performing ""unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks."" Using the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm's future. He's previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would - and in future, in homes. ""Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,"" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X. ""His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet."" Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was ""almost comfortable"" allowing drivers to ""text and drive essentially."" US regulators are after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries. Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months. Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring. Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks ""another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business."" Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. It is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added. Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over ""the polarisation of [Musk's] persona"" which has ""demolished the value of the brand"". ""Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,"" he said. Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him ""Tesla's biggest asset"" in a note published after the vote. ""We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,"" Mr Ives added. Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he ""hit those milestones ahead of schedule"" in 2018. She said his political interests had created some ""polarisation"", but his pay package did not ""put any constraints on his activities"" outside of the company. Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did. But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk. Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision. The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday's meeting. In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts. A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk. Kathryn Hannon, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said the new pay deal would give Musk ""increasing voting power over the company"", which he had long been requesting for a number of years. ""Elon Musk, whether you like him or not, he is a visionary in this space and I guess putting the correct governance and incentivisation structures around him to deliver this does align him, hopefully, with shareholders on that success journey."""
China US,"Mass killings probe in Sudan will hold culprits to account, vows UN",2025-11-14T17:24:51.089Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70jd4elgwzo,"The UN human rights council has given unanimous backing to a fresh, independent investigation into mass killings reported in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher. ""Our wake-up calls were not heeded. Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,"" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher. The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies  ""fuelling and profiting"" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,"" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. ""[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,"" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered ""the world's largest humanitarian crisis"". It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called ""Quad"" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: ""We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved."" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by ""the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher"" and accused the Sudanese army of ""starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons"". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called ""all biased statements against them"" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth . Speaking on Friday, Türk said: ""There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action"" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. ""It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population."" The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF ""isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it"". He also said he did not want to ""diminish"" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying ""that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side"", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups."
China US,The private notes and secret documents that tell the inside story of the UK's Covid response,2025-11-20T00:12:50.970Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78zy20ydlmo,"It was the most momentous event in UK history since World War Two. As a new virus took hold, millions of us were told to stay at home and billions of pounds were spent propping up the country's economy. The Covid inquiry will publish its second set of findings on Thursday, looking in detail at the huge political choices made at the time - including how lockdowns were introduced, the closure of businesses and schools, and bringing in previously unthinkable social restrictions. ""Did the government serve the people well, or did it fail them?"" asked the lead counsel at the start of this part of the inquiry in 2023. Since then more than 7,000 documents have been made public from the time, including WhatsApp chats and emails, private diaries and confidential files. Here, BBC News has picked out some of the urgent messages and scribbled notes that shine a light on how critical decisions were taken in 2020. On 2 January 2020 , a service used by health workers to warn of emerging diseases. ""World Health Organization in touch with Beijing after mystery viral pneumonia outbreak,"" it says. ""Twenty-seven people - most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - treated in hospital."" The next day England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, sends the bulletin on to Peter Horby, a professor at Oxford University and chair of Nervtag, a group that advises the government on new viral threats. By the end of January, it's clear the health authorities in Wuhan have a major problem on their hands. The deputy ambassador to China, Christina Scott, comparing the situation to the outbreak of another virus - SARS - in 2003. ""Hubei province on lockdown; multiple cities have transport restrictions. Memory of SARS cover-up ensures residual distrust of government response,"" it says. ""They will do everything they can to quickly control this outbreak. But the challenge of doing so is substantial."" The virus spreads to Thailand and South Korea and then to Iran and northern Italy. At lunchtime on Saturday 7 March the UK's then prime minister, Boris Johnson, is ahead of the England vs Wales game at Twickenham. Days later, the Cheltenham horse racing festival goes ahead and Atletico Madrid fans are allowed to fly from Spain to Liverpool to watch their team play in the Champions League. The government's strategy, backed by its scientific advisers, is to try to contain early outbreaks by isolating those with the virus and tracing any contacts. The plan is then to move to a ""delay phase"" as full community transmission is established – using policies like home isolation advice for those with symptoms to ""flatten the curve"" of the pandemic so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed. But the virus is spreading much faster than expected and it‘s quickly becoming clear to some scientists that far stronger action will be needed. On Friday 13 March, two senior No 10 officials are sitting in a key meeting of scientific advisers in Whitehall. ""WE ARE NOT READY,"" . The other leans over and crosses out ""NOT READY"", replacing it with an expletive. That weekend, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is locked in a series of meetings with the PM and a handful of select staff as a new strategy takes shape. Grainy smartphone images show whiteboards in No 10 and . One graph suggests that, if the virus was allowed to run its course without any restrictions in place, then more than 100,000 people would die ""in [hospital] corridors"" in the coming wave. On Sunday 15 March, Cummings : ""FYI – [Patrick] Vallance [the chief scientific adviser] is on board with what will NEVER be discussed as Plan B."" ""[In a] nutshell: we move through the gears to [do] whatever we need to stop NHS collapse and buy time to increase capacity."" Over the following week, Covid rules across the UK are tightened. People are advised, but not legally required, to avoid all non-essential contact and work from home where possible. Then schools are closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas. But still there are concerns that even those measures are not strong enough. On Sunday 22 March, London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, . The next evening, in a televised address watched by 27 million people, the prime minister tells the public they must stay at home as he announces the first national lockdown. It will now be up to the inquiry to decide if making that call earlier could have saved lives and ultimately reduced the total time that people had to stay locked indoors. Over the next month some hospitals do come under severe pressure with intensive care units spilling into corridors and side rooms. Pre-planned or elective care is put on hold but at no point does the NHS have to turn away emergency patients. Covid infections, hospitalisations and deaths start to fall. But the cost of lockdown restrictions is huge: education is disrupted, loneliness and mental health problems get worse, and jobs and businesses are impacted. On 22 May, Johnson asking for a plan to ""start operation BOUNCEBACK"". That month some restrictions begin to be lifted – soon groups of six are able to meet outdoors and schools start a phased re-opening. In the summer, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak tries to boost the economy with his Eat Out to Help Out scheme - 50% off food and drinks for three days a week in August. The idea is well received by the hospitality industry but there are concerns about the health impact. On WhatsApp (with spelling mistakes), Hancock warns Simon Case, then the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, that it's - that’s those local authorities with the highest infection rates. In his evidence to the inquiry, saying a second wave ""happened in every other country in Europe"". But that tension – between controlling Covid and protecting the economy – becomes even more intense through the autumn. Many scientists advising the government want to see tighter rules. They campaign for a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown to try to drive down infections. At times the documents suggest the prime minister supports tougher restrictions, at others he appears determined to avoid another strict national lockdown at all costs. On WhatsApp – using an emoji of a broken trolley as he appears to swerve from one policy position to another. ""This government doesn't have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not to,"" writes Case, who is now the new cabinet secretary, to Cummings and Lee Cain, No 10 director of communications, on 14 October. ""We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this."" In his testimony to the inquiry, Case later says he regrets expressing his ""at-the-moment frustrations"" with Johnson, whom he ""barely knew"" at the time. In his evidence, Johnson defends his own leadership style, saying his views changed with the scientific evidence, and he often adopted certain positions because he wanted to hear the counter arguments. As the nights draw in that autumn, it becomes clear that existing restrictions in England - including a 10pm curfew and the so-called tiered system of local controls - are not going to be enough to control the virus. By the end of October, the prime minister's frustration is obvious in the long note he marked OFFICIAL/SENSITIVE. In tightly spaced handwriting, Johnson pens 22 detailed points over two A4 pages of the document. He approves of strengthening some local restrictions but bemoans the ""terrible cost"" and wonders ""for HOW LONG?"" ""Is NHS T&T [test and trace] actually achieving ANYTHING?"" he asks at one point. A week later, on 5 November 2020, England does enter its second national lockdown, this time lasting four weeks, although most schools remain open. By this point many decisions are being taken independently by the four nations of the UK. Both Wales and Northern Ireland put in place versions of a circuit breaker lockdown, while in Scotland stricter rules are imposed in the central belt. The plan is still to allow families and friends to meet up at Christmas. But by mid-December a new, more infectious variant of the virus is spreading and millions living in the south-east of England are told at short notice that Christmas mixing will be cancelled. In January 2021, a third and final full national lockdown follows across the UK, as the winter wave peaks and the NHS starts rolling out millions of doses of the first Covid vaccines. Five years on from those dramatic 12 months, the inquiry's findings are long-awaited, particularly by the 235,000 families who lost loved ones in the pandemic. The messages and documents highlighted here are just a snapshot - the report due later will run to around 800 pages. It will examine some of the key questions in much more detail: the timing of lockdowns, the impact of restrictions on the most vulnerable, and public confidence in the rules amid reports of partying in Downing Street and other alleged rule breaches. Groups representing thousands of bereaved families want individuals working in government at the time to be held to account for any pandemic failings. But - above all - they want the state to learn lessons from any mistakes and be better prepared if and when the next unknown virus arrives on our shores.

China US,Swap shops reducing waste grow in popularity ,2025-11-08T07:25:02.177Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced6zg2qe40o,"A community group dedicated to reducing waste said the popularity of its ""swap shop"" events is increasing. Sustainable Devizes first held a Devizes Swap Shop in 2022 from a small stand in the town's market place, with a couple of tables of books and toys. The event, which is now held at least three times a year and is attended by hundreds of people, is taking place later at St James' Church. People are encouraged to donate unwanted toys, games, crafts, books, houseplants and school uniforms, and can take anything away for free in exchange. Helen Langford now volunteers at the swap shops after first using the service herself. ""One time, I found it quite moving because I remember a particular lady who had a few children with her and she was basically saying, 'I couldn't have got through Christmas without this', and I knew it was making a really big difference,"" she said. ""For me personally, I was driven by trying to be more eco-friendly and trying to spend less, waste less and see stuff used for its whole life, rather than just used for a  season and out the door."" The founder, Sam Drury Shore, said: ""The reason I love the swaps is the co-benefits they bring. ""Our initial motivation was very much about reducing waste, and trying to gently change people's mindsets around consumption. ""But with the cost of living crisis, we can really see that the swaps are a huge help to families - hopefully without it seeming patronising or stigmatising as our framing is 'you are helping by reducing waste', rather than 'you are being helped by being given free stuff'."" The Devizes Swap Shop is taking place at St James' Church from 10:00 GMT."
China US,Mysterious drones have been spotted at night at airports across Europe. How worried should we be?,2025-11-17T00:17:43.171Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkl3d6pegpo,"It's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens. This is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine. These are attack drones that explode on impact. Drones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield. Across western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of ""hybrid warfare"" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine. Recent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries. Now, there is talk that a ""drone wall"" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic? On 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports. Nato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions. This was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began. Which is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing. ""This momentum is really driven by these recent incursions,"" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank. Drones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space. On the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices. But these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall. Previously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September. So, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond? After all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: ""[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money."" Ukraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians. Then there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet. But there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war. That is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared. Sometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports. This includes a suspected drone incursion above Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. Unlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these ""civilian drones"" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships. Suspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility. Belgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions). There is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base? The UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones. Still, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants. The plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia. The wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea. It's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027. Not surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia. Katja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue. But she adds:  ""This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders."" Nonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic. Robert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some ""sort of impervious wall"", is, in his words, out of the question. Yet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try. ""For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,"" he says. ""The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable"", agrees Ms Bego. ""It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them."" Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones. ""You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets. ""You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill."" Hard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means. Russia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders. As for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters. ""You can have lasers which could be useful as well,"" he adds, ""but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be."" André Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once. As tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called ""hybrid"" or ""grey zone"" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them. These include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables. And yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority. The first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised. Meanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge. Mr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. ""You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres. ""And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap."" The question of finance is a complex one. ""It is a really difficult defence question,"" says Mr Tollast. ""Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well. ""So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people."" It will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets. Initially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it. ""Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion... ""The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets"". As for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, ""they can definitely achieve more protection by then"". While all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them. This all makes it something of a new arms race. ""The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,"" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology. ""It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust. ""The aggressor"", he concludes, ""will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through"". So are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow. ""It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,"" argues Ms Bego. ""And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this."" But any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory. Ever since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war. Building a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another."
China US,Tutoring a baby to make him an 'English gentleman' - Is it worth the money?,2025-11-10T08:38:50.561Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kljww1zdo,"When reading this advert, you would be forgiven for skimming over the words ""first steps"", as a turn of phrase. But, it could be the most significant part of this unique job advert, as it seeks to find a tutor for a one-year-old. Hundreds of applications have now been submitted since the anonymous family published their request for the £180k-a-year tutor, who has to be ""someone very special"". Over the last few weeks, the advert has gained attention across the media, with many questioning why? Adam Caller, CEO and founder of Tutors International, which is assisting the family in their search, said despite initial scepticism, he found the idea ""far sighted"", and ""progressive"". When he met the family, he said they appreciated the unusual nature of their request, and how young their son is. However, they explained that they ""didn't want to wait any longer"" to get a tutor, as they had waited until their older child was five, and by that stage ""cultural bias had already set in"". But what does the family mean by ""cultural bias""? It's ""everything"", Adam replied. ""The way you eat, the way you speak."" He said the older sibling had picked ""really subtle, non-verbal cues"" from the family, and had adopted their cultural ways. The family told Adam they did not want history to repeat itself with their new baby. The plan: , who must speak with received pronunciation, to influence the baby right from the beginning. ""A lot of the learning at the beginning here is kind of osmotic,"" said Adam. It's via this osmosis that the family are hoping the child will pick up the British traits they wish to instil. Adam said the tutor had to be somebody who went to ""the right kinds of schools - the same kinds of schools as the family aspire to send their son to"". ""The tutor just has to be the right kind of person, they'll be doing things they don't even know they're doing, just naturally,"" he said. The family told Adam the successful candidate should ideally also have knowledge of or interest in horse-riding, skiing, the arts and music so as to influence the child in a broad spectrum of interests. More than that though, he said the family wanted the tutor to enrol the child on a range of classes so the child would be ""pony-riding and picking up an instrument by the time they are around three years old"". In the family's minds, helping their son become a ""British gentleman"" will lead to success and open doors. ""For all the rights and wrongs of that, because it's definitely a class statement,"" he adds. But, despite all this tutelage in ""Britishness"", could the child pick up so-called cultural bias from the international family he lives with anyway? ""Yes"", said Adam. ""The family know this may not work, but they've just taken the view of, 'let's give it a go and let's go as early as we can', because the cost of it is not relevant,"" he said. There are some in the tutoring industry who share those concerns. Peter Cui, CEO and founder of Blue Education, which also offers private tutors, wrote that ""the process of becoming bicultural, or indeed, becoming oneself, is something that must be lived into, not engineered"". Peter wrote that he had moved from China to the UK at the age of seven, and had been raised knowing and living both cultures. He went on to study at Cambridge University. ""The idea that one individual can serve as a living vessel of Britishness, someone who can somehow transplant the qualities of a British gentleman on to a one-year-old child, strikes me as idealistic and unrealistic,"" he wrote. ""In my experience, having a quintessentially British tutor from infancy will not automatically produce the outcome they desire. ""I never had such a figure, and yet I have been fortunate enough to live many of the experiences they aspire for their son."" He added: ""The truth is, cultural identity cannot be imposed from the outside; it must be chosen, and it must come from within."" Of course, Britishness is something Adam hopes can be taught - and sold. ""I think the fact that the world holds us in this regard is something that we should be cherishing and taking advantage of at the same time,"" he said. ""I don't think that, as British people, we should be embarrassed by this,"" Adam said. ""I think we should be proud of it."" The market for buying Britishness isn't just helping Adam's tutoring business, it's given rise to businesses such as Laura Windsor's Etiquette Academy. Laura, like other ""etiquette experts"", can teach people - for a fee - how to take afternoon tea, dress and hold a conversation, ""like a British person"". ""Society has become so diluted and unrestrained, people now want to go back to the way it was,"" she said. The demand for etiquette training is mainly from international clients who wish to be able to interact at business meetings and functions, she said. But she also teaches groups of children too. Why? ""Because being a polite gentleman or gentlewoman is all about first impressions,"" she said. ""Being polite means you respect other people, you make them feel comfortable and important. When you make people feel important, you're liked, and that opens doors to incredible opportunities."" She says she teaches people how it's ""all in the details"": ""It's about opening doors, and saying 'please' and 'thank you', and thinking about the other person."" Laura's students are never usually as young as one, but starting that young is something the etiquette expert says can have benefits. ""Starting at one, they will grow up being a gentleman, and therefore it's not a question of 'tweaking', it's who they are. ""Whereas nowadays, people need to be tweaked a little bit, to be a little bit more aware of what they do,"" she said. Raising his children to be classically British - with all the etiquette trimmings - is not the priority for Daniel (not his real name). ""Far from leaning into English, British values, we wanted the total opposite. We are trying to go away from the UK system and the straitjacket of that,"" he said. Daniel is currently employing one of Adam's super-tutors to work with his three children around their school hours. Next year the tutor will accompany the whole family as they move abroad for work. For Daniel and his wife, it's about teaching emotional intelligence, and preparing their children for a world influenced by artificial intelligence. Neither believes this is possible without an external tutor. The current British school system ""isn't fit for purpose"", he said, adding that one private school in London, has now dropped most of the GCSE examination system and instead uses its own in-house system which involves more group work activities and project-based learning. ""If GCSEs aren't going to be recognised everywhere - and are not the gold standard - maybe we would be better leaning into a tutor where we get so much more out of it,"" Daniel said. ""Right here, right now, in the UK school system, if I look at the quality of teacher my kids would get at a private school versus these tutors, it's an absolute joke - there is a real discrepancy,"" he said. He added that he recognised hiring a high-end tutor was for ""those in a lucky financial situation"", but explained that since private school fees , he felt the cost of the private tutor had become comparable for three children. ""My kids could have one-20th of a very average person's attention in school, or they could have one-third of an absolutely exceptional person - it's an absolute no-brainer."""
China US,Where is The Celebrity Traitors castle and can I ride the train?,2025-11-07T08:54:27.414Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4njdj4kxw2o,"The winner of The Celebrity Traitors was unveiled in a dramatic finale on Thursday night. The hit BBC series' inaugural celebrity edition featured a line-up of contestants including comedian Stephen Fry, singer Paloma Faith and Olympian Tom Daley. Host Claudia Winkleman pitted a handful of secret traitors against faithfuls at Ardross Castle, a grand Highland property that is one of the reality TV show's biggest stars - including a challenge on the Strathspey Railway. The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century pile about 30 miles north of Inverness. It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland near the Easter Ross town of Alness. The property was built more than 170 years ago in a Scottish baronial style, a type of elaborate architecture featuring complex rooflines with turrets and fortress-like battlements. More than 200 years ago - long before the castle was built - the land at Ardross was owned by George Granville Leveson-Gower, the 1st Duke of Sutherland. He had a hunting lodge on the site where the castle stands today. The duke was a controversial figure in the Highland Clearances. In large parts of Sutherland, he had people cleared off land where they had lived for generations to make way for sheep farming and agricultural ""improvements"". Some families were moved to coastal villages, while others became emigrants and made difficult journeys to Canada to start new lives there. There is a statue of the duke on a hilltop north of Ardross. Known locally as The Mannie, and overlooking Golspie, it has been the target of vandalism and even attempts . Years later the estate at Ardross was bought by Sir Alexander Matheson. Matheson made his fortune . He was an MP and an instrumental figure in the building of railways in the Highlands. And he had the castle, so familiar to Traitors fans today, constructed. Ross and Cromarty Heritage Society says that from 1847, about 400 workers were involved in the property's construction. They built 30 rooms and laid out the castle's extensive grounds. According to Ardross Castle's website, Sir Alexander also improved estate workers' housing. After Sir Alexander's death, the country house and its estate was sold to businessman and philanthropist Charles William Dyson Perrins. His grandfather William Perrins, in partnership with John Wheeley Lea, created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce. The Perrins family was also involved in the production of Royal Worcester porcelain. Charles William Dyson Perrins joined the family business after four years serving in the Highland Light Infantry. He and his family were annual visitors to Ardross Castle. The Perrins' ownership came to an end in the 1930s and various parts of the estate was sold off. In 1983, the castle was bought by the McTaggart family and they still own it today. While not run as a hotel, the property is available as a wedding venue - its popularity undoubtedly boosted by its appearance in The Traitors. In 2023, Loukas Tsarmaklis, a director of Ardross Castle Enterprises, told they ""try to keep a low profile... but there is no chance now."" ""This has put us on the map and helped local B&Bs, tradesmen, taxi drivers, cleaners. It was a big operation for this part of the world,"" he added. The castle's owners politely declined to comment on the impact the show has had to BBC Scotland News, but internet searches for the castle have been on the rise. Ross and Cromarty Heritage Society said views of its page about Ardross increased significantly because of the US show. Strathspey Railway is a volunteer-run company that operates a 10-mile (16km) route between Aviemore and Broomhill, via Boat of Garten. The heritage railway's line is part of the former Inverness and Perth Junction Railway, later called the Highland, which linked Aviemore with Forres. It is one of only a handful of former lines to be preserved following rail closures in the 1960s. The company has a fleet of steam and diesel locomotives which are run and maintained by a mix of volunteers and a small number of paid staff. It has frequently been involved in restoration projects, . The Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 engine - No. 46464 - was one of five built in Crewe, Cheshire, in 1950. It spent most of its working life based at Dundee Tay Bridge Steam Shed 62B, operating on services in Angus and Fife. Last week, Strathspey Railway said it had received a £1m donation from a mystery American donor . The railway runs trips throughout the year and is now operating to a winter timetable, which includes a festive Elf Express. Joining Claudia Winkleman in the castle were . They included comedian Alan Carr, singer and broadcaster Charlotte Church and former England rugby player Joe Marler. Also, broadcaster Kate Garraway, presenter Jonathan Ross and content creator Niko Omilana. Among those from the world of acting were Mark Bonnar, Tamela Empson and Celia Imrie."
China US,A simple guide to what is happening in Sudan,2025-11-13T14:12:12.647Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjel2nn22z9o,"Sudan plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious struggle for power broke out between its army and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It has led to a famine and claims of a genocide in the western Darfur region - with fears for the residents of city of el-Fasher after it was recently captured by the RSF. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 12 million have fled their homes in what the United Nations has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Here is what you need to know. It is the latest episode in bouts of tension that followed the 2019 ousting of long-serving President Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in a coup in 1989. There were huge street protests calling for an end to his near-three decade rule and the army mounted a coup to get rid of him. But civilians continued to campaign for the introduction of democracy. A joint military-civilian government was then established but that was overthrown in another coup in October 2021. The coup was staged by the two men at the centre of the current conflict: But then Gen Burhan and Gen Dagalo disagreed on the direction the country was going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule. The main sticking points were plans to incorporate the 100,000-strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the new force. The suspicions were that both generals wanted to hang on to their positions of power, unwilling to lose wealth and influence. Shooting between the two sides began on 15 April 2023 following days of tension as members of the RSF were redeployed around the country in a move that the army saw as a threat. It is disputed who fired the first shot but the fighting swiftly escalated, with the RSF seizing much of Khartoum until the army regained control of it almost two years later in March 2025. The RSF was formed in 2013 and , where they were accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the region's black African, non-Arab population. Since then, Gen Dagalo has built a powerful force that has intervened in conflicts in Yemen and Libya. He also controls some of Sudan's gold mines, and allegedly smuggles the metal to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The army accuses the UAE of backing the RSF, and carrying out drone strikes in Sudan. The oil-rich Gulf state denies the allegation. The army also accuses eastern Libyan strongman Gen Khalifa Haftar of supporting the RSF by helping it to smuggle weapons into Sudan, and sending fighters to bolster the RSF. In early June 2025, the RSF achieved a major victory when it took control of territory along Sudan's border with Libya and Egypt. This was followed by the capture of el-Fasher in late October, meaning it controls almost all of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan. With the RSF's recent formation of a rival government, it is likely Sudan will split for a second time - South Sudan seceded in 2011, taking with it most of the country's oil fields. The military controls most of the north and the east. Its main backer is said to be Egypt, whose fortunes are intertwined with those of Sudan because they share a border and the waters of the River Nile. Gen Burhan has turned Port Sudan - which is on the Red Sea - into his headquarters, and that of his UN-recognised government. However, the city is not safe - the RSF launched a there in March. This was retaliation after the RSF suffered one of its biggest setbacks, when it lost control of Khartoum - including the Republican Palace - to the army in March. ""Khartoum is free, it's done,"" Gen Burhan declared, as he triumphantly returned to the city, though not permanently. by the time the RSF left, with government ministries, banks and towering office blocks stand blackened and burned. Hospitals and clinics were destroyed, hit by air strikes and artillery fire, sometimes with patients still inside. The international airport - which was a graveyard of smashed planes - re-opened in mid-October to domestic flights, though its official opening was delayed by a day because a RSF drone hit an area nearby. The army has also managed to win back near total control of the crucial state of Gezira. , forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee its main city of Wad Madani, which had become a refuge for those who had escaped conflict in other parts of the country. But el-Fasher, which was the last major urban centre in Darfur held by the army and its allies, . Over 18 months, the RSF laid siege to the city, causing hundreds of casualties, overwhelming hospitals and blocking food supplies. It recently stepped up it efforts by building an earthen wall around the city to trap residents and stop food from reaching people - and destroyed the nearby Zamzam displacement camp which had already been hit by famine. Many Darfuris believe the RSF and allied militias have waged a war aimed at transforming the ethnically mixed region into an Arab-dominated area. In March 2024, the UN children's agency, Unicef, gave harrowing accounts of armed men . Some children have tried to end their own lives as a result. In the same month, in Darfur against the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities. Thousands had been killed in el-Geneina city in a campaign of ethnic cleansing with the ""apparent objective of at least having them permanently leave the region"", it said. HRW added that the widespread killings raised the possibility that the RSF and their allies had ""the intent to destroy in whole or in part""  the Massalit people. As this could constitute a genocide, it appealed to international bodies and governments to carry out an investigation. fell short of concluding that a genocide was taking place. Instead, it found that that both the RSF and army had committed war crimes. However, the US determined in January this year that the RSF and allied militias have committed a genocide. ""The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys - even infants - on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,"" then-Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said. ""Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies. Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,"" he added. This led to the US imposing sanctions on Gen Dagalo, followed by . Sudan's government filed a case against the UAE in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of being complicit in the genocide by funding and arming the RSF. However, the ICJ refused to hear the case, saying that it had no jurisdiction over it. The UAE welcomed its ruling, with an official saying that the Gulf state . However, UN experts say allegations that the UAE is supporting the RSF are credible. The RSF also denies committing genocide, saying it was not involved in what it describes as a ""tribal conflict"" in Darfur. But the UN investigators said they had received testimony that RSF fighters taunted non-Arab women during sex attacks with racist slurs and saying they will force them to have ""Arab babies"". With reports of there are concerns about the fate of an estimated 250,000 people in the city, many from non-Arab communities. There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but they have failed. In early November, the RSF announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt. However, , accusing the RSF of not respecting ceasefires. UN health chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also lamented that there is less global interest in the conflict in Sudan, and other recent conflicts in Africa, compared to crises elsewhere in the world. ""I think race is in the play here,"" . The International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank has called diplomatic efforts to end the war ""lacklustre"", while Amnesty International has labelled the world's response ""woefully inadequate"". Humanitarian work has also been badly affected by the decision of the Trump administration to cut aid. The WFP says more than 24 million people in the country are facing acute food insecurity. Aid volunteers told the BBC that more than 1,100 - or almost 80% - of the , fuelling the perception that Sudan's conflict is the ""forgotten war"" of the world. There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of Sudan despite calls from human rights groups. The flow of weapons into the country has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - . The UAE in particular is accused of being the main provider of arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. As for the Sudanese Armed Forces, . All parties deny these allegations. In October 2025, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to ""end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF"", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: ""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously."" At a later summit of G7 foreign ministers, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to the RSF. Sudan is in north-east Africa and is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million sq km (734,000 sq miles). It borders seven countries and the Red Sea. The River Nile also flows through it, making it a strategically important for foreign powers. The population of Sudan is predominantly Muslim and the country's official languages are Arabic and English. Even before the war started, Sudan was one of the poorest countries in the world - despite the fact that it is a gold-producing nation. Its 46 million people were living on an average annual income of $750 (£600) a head in 2022. The conflict has made things much worse. Last year, Sudan's finance minister said state revenues had shrunk by 80%."
China US,William puts flood-hit Welsh town in COP spotlight,2025-11-07T13:04:28.241Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4j8er4xjmo,"The Prince of Wales has put the plight of a flood-ravaged town in south Wales at the heart of his message to world leaders gathered in Brazil for the COP30 summit. Prince William said he was ""deeply moved"" by the resilience of the people in Pontypridd, whom he in February after devastating . ""One resident told me how the river that once brought life to the town had become a source of fear,"" he said, in a high-profile speech given in the city of Belem, in the heart of the Amazon. The prince called for ""courage, co-operation and unwavering commitment"" to tackle the climate crisis, warning of a ""critical tipping point"" ahead. ""We must ask ourselves, what legacy do we wish to leave?"" said Prince William, who was joined by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and  Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the annual climate summit. The prince warned humanity was edging towards the ""Earth's critical tipping points"", citing ""the melting of polar ice, the loss of the Amazon, the disruption of ocean currents"". ""These are not distant threats,"" he said. ""They are fast-approaching and will affect every one of us, no matter where we live."" In Pontypridd, earlier this year, the prince said he and the princess met ""families who had lost their homes, their possessions, and their sense of security"". ""Their resilience was deeply moving. ""It was also a powerful reminder that climate change is not a distant threat,"" he said. ""It is affecting lives across the UK, and across the world - from small towns to major cities, from coastal communities to inland regions. ""No corner of the globe will be unaffected."" Sir Keir spoke directly after Prince William, challenging climate sceptics with a promise to double-down on net zero, on the issue of climate change. The Prime Minister staunchly defended the UK government's clean energy agenda, but conceded that cross-party unity on science ""that is unequivocal"" has splintered, both in Britain and globally. Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit. After Thursday's speech, the prince posed for a picture with Brazil's president, Lula, and Sir Keir, laughing as they brought their hands together in a triple handshake, and walking off the stage in unison. The speech at COP30 was Prince William's highest-profile public address to date, speaking on behalf of the UK government and his father, King Charles, with whom he shared the contents of his address before his departure for Brazil. ""I grew up with my father – the King – talking about the power of nature and the importance of harmony in the natural world,"" he said. ""A subject he has championed for over five decades. ""It is a privilege to also represent him here today, as well as everyone else who has championed this cause, for so many years."" The prince also praised as ""visionary"" a Brazilian-led fund for rainforests – seen as key to the UN Cop30 climate summit, but which the British Government has said it will not currently invest in, ahead of the Budget later this month. Prince William's five-day trip to Brazil, his first to the country, included , on Wednesday ""When we unite behind shared purpose, we can scale and accelerate solutions that transcend borders,"" he told delegates at COP30. ""Solutions that give us hope, and fill us with optimism, for the future."" He went on to talk about one of the Earthshot Prize finalists, as he called for unity in the fight for climate change. ""Brazil's proposal for the Tropical Forests Forever fund is a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability. That is why it was an Earthshot Prize finalist this year. ""The initiative recognises that climate and nature must be addressed together – not in silos, but in synergy. ""The science is clear – we must go further if we are to secure a liveable future for all. And we must go together. ""The time for partnership, protection, and progress is now. ""We know what is at stake. We know what must be done. And we know that no country, no community, no individual can do it alone."""
China US,Asylum seekers will be banned from taking taxis for medical appointments,2025-11-29T13:27:54.541Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjn2y4eed5o,"Asylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced. It comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxis or minicabs, with one asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, . In response, the government into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September. Now the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around £15.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers. Earlier this year, found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used. On Friday, one driver told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said. Another taxi driver, who gave the name Steve, claimed firms would purposely increase the mileage on trips by dispatching drivers to another distant town to carry out short journeys. He told File on Four that on one occasion he was sent from Gatwick Airport to Reading - a round trip of about 110 miles (175km) and costing more than £100 - to take an asylum seeker from their hotel to a dentist appointment which was 1.5 miles away. Steve said that while working for a subcontractor he was sent from Gatwick to Southampton ""more than once"", and that he drove an average of 275 miles a day - half of which was without a passenger in his car. He claimed that some journeys were completely wasted. ""I'd be sitting there and [would be told] 'oh look don't worry, [the asylum seekers] don't wanna go' and they basically refused to move. It just logistically wasn't thought out very well and I think it was left open to abuse,"" he said. But Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this was now going to change. She said: ""I am ending the unrestricted use of taxis by asylum seekers for hospital appointments, authorising them only in the most exceptional circumstances. ""I will continue to root out waste as we close every single asylum hotel."" She said the government had inherited expensive Conservative contracts. Instead of taxis, ministers want asylum seekers to use alternatives like public transport. There will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy-related needs. These will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules. There are other circumstances in which taxis can be used - such as moving between accommodation - but ministers are reviewing the wider use of taxis for asylum seekers and want to extend the principle that they are only used in exceptional circumstances with support evidence. Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said the current use of taxis was ""symptomatic of an asylum system that allows private contractors to make vast profits at the expense of the taxpayer"". He added that: ""It is more a consequence of government incompetence and poor contract management than people in the asylum system exploiting it."" Mr Solomon called for an end to ""profiteering"" contracts and for more asylum seekers to be allowed to work ""so they can support themselves"". Ministers have pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the next election. They want to increase the use of alternative accommodation, such as large military sites. But figures earlier this week showed 36,273 people were still living in asylum hotels in the UK - an increase compared to June. There has also been criticism of the growing cost of running asylum accommodation, which has gone up significantly since the contracts were signed. When the home secretary was asked if the government was prepared to exercise break clauses in contracts with providers in a BBC interview earlier this year, Mahmood said she would explore all options. But doing so would mean alternative accommodation needs to be found. The government has also announced significant changes to overhaul the asylum system, with refugee status becoming temporary and the ending of guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers. The since it came to power but the chair of the home affairs select committee said that was only a start. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: ""The issue is that Labour can't get a grip on the illegal immigration crisis. ""As Labour hammer working people with £26 billion in tax rises, they have allowed costs for illegal arrivals to spiral because Labour don't have the backbone to take the tough decisions needed. ""Namely, deporting all illegal arrivals and leaving the ECHR. Until that happens, the bills will keep mounting."""
