The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given ""the Hu Jintao treatment"".

""Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!"" he wrote. However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. ""How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?"" a Weibo user wrote. Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the ""people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour"" she wrote on Instagram.

China Japan,Chinese and Japanese boats face off near disputed islands as feud worsens,2025-12-02T07:26:10.130Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk7xjpv8gmo,"China and Japan's coast guards have given different accounts of a confrontation that occurred near a group of geopolitically sensitive islands in the East China Sea. China's Coast Guard said on Tuesday that a Japanese fishing vessel had illegally entered the waters of the Diaoyu Islands - which Tokyo calls the Senkaku Islands. China claims them as their territory, despite the islands being administered by Japan. Japan's Coast Guard, meanwhile, said it intercepted and expelled two Chinese Coast Guard ships as they approached the fishing vessel. The confrontation comes as , after Japan's leader made controversial comments about Taiwan last month. While responding to a question in parliament in November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards each other, with the widening rift affecting daily life for citizens in both countries. Taiwan is located about 160km south-west of the Senkaku Islands. China Coast Guard (CCG) spokesperson Liu Dejun said that Chinese vessels on Tuesday approached and warned off a Japanese fishing boat that had ""illegally entered the territorial waters of China's Diaoyu Dao"", according to a state media report. Liu added that the CCG took ""necessary law enforcement measures"", claiming that the islands were Chinese territory and urging Japan to ""immediately stop all acts of infringement and provocation in these waters"". The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) offered a slightly different account, saying they approached the Chinese vessels shortly after they were seen entering Japanese waters in the early hours of Tuesday and issued a demand that they leave the waters. The JCG's patrol ship ensured the fishing boat's safety until the CCG left the territory a few hours later, it said. While Japan and China made an in-principle agreement in 2008 to jointly exploit resources in the East China Sea, the waterway that separates the two countries, tensions have escalated over the past decade-and-a-half. The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which are uninhabited, . China has sent an increasing number of ships towards the islands, in what appears to be an attempt to test Japan's resolve to defend them. Last year, the number of days Chinese government vessels were spotted in the territory hit a record high for the third consecutive year. There were also a record number of CCG vessels operating in the waters.

China Japan,What to know about China and Japan's escalating spat over Taiwan,2025-11-18T09:54:37.749Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo,"China and Japan have been locked in an escalating row, set off by Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion earlier this month that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. In response, a Chinese diplomat made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. But what began as a war of words has now gone beyond barbs:  Both countries' foreign ministries have since lodged serious protests with each other. Japan has also warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while China urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan. Some Chinese airlines have even offered refunds for flights to Japan. The release of two popular Japanese films in China have also been postponed. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding ""strategic ambiguity"" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan. Here's what you need to know about it: The current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan on 7 November, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan. ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,"" Takaichi responded. A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat. Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as ""egregious"". The following day, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that ""the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off"". While the intent of Xue's remarks ""may not be clear"", they were ""highly inappropriate"", aid Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara. Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's. Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet. Takaichi has declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as ""consistent with the government's traditional position"". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on. Meanwhile, China has turned up the heat on Japan, summoning the Japanese ambassador and repeatedly demanding that Takaichi takes back her words. On social media, China's foreign ministry warned Japan to ""stop playing with fire"" and added that it would be an ""act of aggression"" if Japan ""dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation"". China has urged its citizens ""to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future"" over what it called ""blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan"". This could deal a blow to Japan's tourism industry, which is supported by millions of Chinese visitors every year. Japan's tourism and retail stocks have . For their part, Japanese authorities say their position of supporting ""peaceful resolution"" to issues on Taiwan ""has not changed"". They have also urged China to ""take appropriate action"" over Xue's social media post. This week, the releases of at least , with distributors citing ""sentiments of the domestic audience"", Chinese state media reported. Chinese state media CCTV added that cinema ticket sales for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had also fallen recently. There is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two. This was brought up by a Chinese defence official last week, who said Japan would face ""crushing defeat"" by the Chinese military if it ""failed to draw lessons from history and dared to take reckless risks"". Historical grievances may have long been sore spots in bilateral relations, but the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe suggests more tensions may lie ahead. The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing. Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea. The Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan. This is in line with the policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish. The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security. On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing. In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to ""correct its mistakes"". In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were ""a gross interference in China's internal affairs"". ""Taiwan is China's Taiwan,"" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not ""tolerate any foreign interference"" on the matter. ""What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?"" he added. ""Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?"""

Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea. The Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan. This is in line with the policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish. The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security. On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing. In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to ""correct its mistakes"". In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were ""a gross interference in China's internal affairs"". ""Taiwan is China's Taiwan,"" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not ""tolerate any foreign interference"" on the matter. ""What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?"" he added. ""Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?"""
China Japan,India and China trade barbs after passenger detained at Shanghai airport,2025-11-26T07:30:38.416Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9kz127w0o,"The detention of Pema Wangjom Thongdok, an Indian citizen living in the UK, at Shanghai airport has fuelled a diplomatic row between Delhi and Beijing. Ms Thongdok said she was detained by immigration officials while travelling from London to Japan via Shanghai last Friday because her passport lists her birthplace as the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. China disputes India's claim over the region and considers Arunachal its territory, calling it ""South Tibet"" - a claim India firmly rejects. On Tuesday, India it had lodged a protest against Ms Thongdok's detention and reiterated that Arunachal was an ""integral and inalienable"" part of India. Ms Thongdok, who called the experience ""humiliating"", contacted the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing for help. She was released from detention after 18 hours when Indian officials arrived at the airport and spoke to the authorities. India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal called Ms Thongdok's detention ""arbitary"" and said the issued had been taken up strongly with China. ""Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel. Their actions also violate their own regulations that allow visa free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,"" he said in a statement. Mr Jaiswal's statement came hours after China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China's border inspection authorities had ""carried out checks in accordance with laws and regulations"". ""The law enforcement was impartial and non-abusive, the lawful rights of the individual [Ms Thongdok] were fully protected, no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called 'detaining' or 'harassing',"" she told India's PTI news agency. She added that the airline - China Eastern - had provided Ms Thongdok resting facilities and meals. But she insisted that Arunachal was China's territory. ""The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' illegally set up by India,"" she said. The state, which falls along a 3,440km (2,100 mile) de-facto border in the Himalayas - called the Line of Actual Control - has been a source of tension between the Asian neighbours for decades. China says it considers the whole of Arunachal Pradesh its territory, while India claims the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, which is controlled by China. Troops from the countries in Arunachal Pradesh in 2022. The fight took place even as India and China were working to re-establish ties after a clash at the Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region in 2020 led to a complete breakdown in ties. Over the past year or so, India and China have taken some big steps towards normalising relations, including and agreeing on patrolling arrangements to de-escalate border tensions. In August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was in Delhi on a two-day trip, said the neighbours . So, Ms Thongdok's detention amidst these friendly overtures has raised eyebrows in India and made national headlines. She ANI news agency that she had been living in the UK for 14 years and had travelled through Shanghai several times earlier without facing any issues. However, this time an immigration official at the airport ""singled"" her out of the queue and told her that her passport was invalid, she said. ""When I tried to question them and ask them what the issue was, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing and saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian',"" she added."
China Japan,What are small nuclear reactors and why does the UK want to build them? ,2025-11-13T13:14:57.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62614wejk5o,"The UK's first small nuclear power stations will be built on the Isle of Anglesey in north Wales. Back in June, the government promised £2.5bn for small modular reactors (SMRs). It is hoped SMRs will help meet the UK's growing electricity demands, be faster to develop than full size reactors and create thousands of skilled jobs. SMRs, sometimes called ""mini nukes"", work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity. Inside one or more large reactor vessels, atoms of nuclear fuel are split, releasing a large amount of heat. That is used to heat water, which drives a turbine. Essentially, reactors are giant nuclear kettles. SMRs will be a fraction of the size and have up to a third of the generating output of a typical large reactor. The modular element means they will be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station. The aim is to save time and money The government wants a secure, reliable, affordable and low carbon energy system. In 2024, nuclear accounted for 14% of the UK's electricity generation, according to provisional government figures. The aim is to boost that. Along with 30 other countries, the UK has signed . But no new nuclear power station has been built since Sizewell B began operating in 1995. And most of those in operation are due to be retired by the end of the decade. The SMR industry is in its infancy and, around the world, about 80 different designs are being investigated. Only China and Russia have small reactors up and running. The UK government is convinced that, with investment, SMRs will create thousands of jobs and boost manufacturing. Initially though, both government and private investment will be needed to turn the designs into a commercially viable reality. In the US, companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, with their power-hungry data centres, . In June 2025 Great British Energy - Nuclear (GBE-N), a public body with statutory powers to push through the government's nuclear plans, announced Rolls Royce had won a competition to develop and build the first three SMR's in the UK. At the same time the government announced £14.2bn to build a new larger scale reactor, Sizewell C, in Suffolk. In 2011, the Conservative government had earlier identified eight sites for ""new nuclear"" (larger reactors), at Bradwell, Hartlepool, Heysham, Hinkley Point, Oldbury, Sellafield, Sizewell and Wylfa. , Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut planning red tape to make it easier for developers to build smaller nuclear reactors in additional places across the country, old industrial sites, such as former nuclear plants being the preferred areas. The location had to meet certain criteria. No sites would be approved close to airports, military sites or pipelines. Areas valuable for nature or at risk of flooding would also be ruled out. Two decommissioned nuclear facilities become the top runners - Wylfa on Anglesey in north Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. In November 2025 Wylfa was chosen. Wylfa has a nuclear heritage dating back decades which ended in 2025 when its ageing nuclear power plant was closed in 2015. The announcement could provide an economic boost for the area. The Rolls Royce design has to go through multiple levels of scrutiny before it is officially signed off. That final approval is expected late in 2026. The financial controversy around the new large reactor being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset is a perfect example of what the UK is trying to move away from. It is running a decade late and has overspent by billions of pounds. SMRs promise to be quicker, easier and cheaper to build. But while they will eventually be built to order, cost savings don't kick in until designs have been finalised and modules are reliably rolling off factory lines. So the first SMRs will probably be very expensive to build. The cost of dealing with nuclear waste also has to be factored in. Sellafield, in Cumbria, currently deals with most of the country's waste, but it is running out of space and costs are spiralling. any new nuclear power station design should include clear plans for managing waste, to avoid the ""costly mistake of the past"". Taxpayers today are still paying for Sellafield to deal with nuclear waste from the 1950s. Nuclear industry experts the BBC has spoken to are convinced that SMRs - and more nuclear power - will eventually reduce the cost of our electricity supply. Public attitudes to nuclear power appear to be linked to those prices. A government survey in 2024 suggested that 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills. Although for households close to upgraded pylons, there has been no such announcement yet relating to homes near SMRs. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear power plants are among ""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"". Nuclear power's reputation is tarnished though by high profile disasters, where radioactive material has been released into the environment - including in  Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan, in 2011. Dr Simon Middleburgh, a nuclear scientist from Bangor University, whose research focuses on developing new nuclear materials, describes the smaller reactors that are being considered for the UK as ""incredibly safe"". ""The UK's ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation) is treated as a sort of gold standard internationally in terms of the regulatory environment,"" he told BBC News. Some experts do have concerns about nuclear waste. Scientists from the government advisory group recently said the issue of how radioactive waste from SMRs that are in the design stage ""appears, with some exceptions... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed"". The number and location of SMRs is also a security issue. With more reactors spread over a larger area, potentially built on industrial sites and closer to people, Dr Ross Peel, a researcher in civil nuclear security from Kings College London, says the security burden will be higher. Security at nuclear power stations is provided by armed police - the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Dr Peel says the fact that existing nuclear sites generally have ""miles of empty land around them"" means that anyone in the vicinity arouses suspicion. If officers spot anyone they could just ""look through the binoculars and ask 'what are you doing?',"" he said. ""In urban or industrial environments, suddenly you're trying to do security in a very different [way]."""
China Japan,"UK most expensive place to develop nuclear power, report says",2025-11-24T10:18:35.226Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq8jneqpdo,"The UK has become the ""most expensive place in the world"" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises ""overly complex"" bureaucracy around the sector. The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a  ""one-stop shop"" for nuclear decisions. A ""radical reset"" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain ""tens of billions"" in costs and reverse the industry's ""decline"" in recent years, the . It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also , which are faster to build than full-size reactors. The taskforce's report said the planning system needed to be streamlined and the risks associated with nuclear energy should be brought in line with the rest of the world It said the UK had excessively risk-averse policies in place, including ""overly conservative"" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers. A ""fragmented"" regulatory system has led to ""conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed"", it said. The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were ""essential to the UK's future"", with the country at risk of missing out on a ""worldwide nuclear renaissance"". Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: ""Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have ""made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear"". Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said. ""Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety."" The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance. ""A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way."" Several major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity. The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world. The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions. Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024. The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and will take several years to come online. Beyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction. The US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme - now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040. In contrast, Germany has , prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen. The development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl. Mike Childs, head of policy for environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, said: ""Nuclear power has always been and will always be extraordinarily expensive, not because of regulation but because of the nature of the technology. ""Investing in energy efficiency, renewable power and energy storage is the economically sensible route to keep energy bills affordable."""
China Japan,India's data centre boom confronts a looming water challenge,2025-11-09T23:18:30.889Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr417pwek7o,"The extraordinary rise of artificial intelligence has turbocharged data centre growth in India, Asia's third largest economy. Data centres - the centralised physical facilities that enable our growing digital existence by hosting computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment - power everything from ChatGPT queries to electric vehicles and streaming services. Last month, made an eye-popping $15bn (£11.49bn) investment in an AI data centre in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh - its biggest in India. It was the latest among a string of investments from companies - including global giants like Amazon Web Services and Meta and local players such as Reliance Industries - that are pumping billions of dollars into India's data centre market. Even luxury real-estate developers have joined the bandwagon to build these computing facilities. The sector is poised for ""explosive growth"", according to global real estate advisory JLL, with India's data centre capacity projected to surge 77% by 2027 to reach 1.8GW. Some $25-30bn is expected to be spent in capacity expansion by 2030, according to various estimates. While vital for India's developmental needs, the growth of such energy hungry, water-guzzling infrastructure has profound implications for the country's decarbonisation plans. India has no option but to attract big data centre investments, some experts say. While the country is said to account for 20% of global data generation, it has only 3% of global data centre capacity. And demand for such infrastructure is soaring, with India expected to consume the most data in the world by 2028 - higher than developed markets like the US, Europe and even China. This consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use, the government's regulatory thrust on hosting user data locally and rapid adoption of AI, which has greater computing needs. AI chatbots like ChatGPT have their second largest user base in India. There's also a strong business case for Indian policymakers to push for such investments and for global firms to commit the money. According to Kotak Research, ""data centre development cost is one of the lowest in India with only China's cost being lower"", and India's electricity cost is a fraction of the US, UK and Japan. The country also has world-class tech talent suited for the industry's growth. ""Just like we exploited the IT services boom through the 90s and 2000s, this is another opportunity that we can use to our advantage,"" Vibhuti Garg, director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the BBC. This boom has, however, presented policymakers with difficult trade-offs. From and to in the US and , serious concerns have been raised around data centres guzzling excess water for their cooling systems and consuming vast amounts of energy at the cost of local communities. In an energy starved, water-scarce India, these challenges are even more accentuated. According to the World Bank, India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. India's data centre water consumption, meanwhile, is expected to more than double from 150 billion litres in 2025 to 358 billion litres by 2030, putting further pressure on its water table. Moreover, most of India's data centres are concentrated in urban clusters like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru which have strong competing water needs. A potential pushback from locals or a loss of licences to build and operate such centres as a result of growing water stress could hit the industry hard over the long term, experts say. There are already some murmurs of discontent. Advocacy groups like the have raised ""alarm"" over the Andhra Pradesh state government's ""public resource diversion"" for Google's proposed data centre, saying that Visakhapatnam city where it is slated to come up is already facing acute water stress which could intensify as a result of this investment. Google directed the BBC to a document which says that the company uses a ""peer-reviewed context-based water-risk framework"" to evaluate local watershed risk at new sites to guide decision-making on whether to use a freshwater source. While India has explicit policies and regulations that govern data protection and data centre development, zoning, energy use etc, ""water use does not figure prominently in any of these policy groups, and is a significant blind spot that places high risk on the long-term functioning of these centres"", Sahana Goswami of WRI India, a water research organisation, told the BBC. An S&P Global study predicts that 60-80% of India's data centres will face high water stress in this decade itself as a result of limited resource availability. This, in turn, could have a cascading impact on other industries. ""Imagine shutdowns of data centres in peak summer due to lack of water for cooling - how might this impact banking services, medical systems in hospitals using cloud services, transit system operations and more,"" says Ms Goswami. Companies need to bring greater innovation and explore mechanisms to use treated domestic and industrial waste water instead of fighting for this limited resource, experts say. ""India itself has examples of such innovation in the data centre space in Navi Mumbai. Further, various power and textile industries are much ahead in partnering with municipal authorities and water utilities,""  says Ms Goswami. Praveen Ramamurthy, a water recycling expert from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru city, agrees. ""Non-potable or treated water must be made mandatory for cooling needs,"" he told the BBC, adding that India must also select ""low-stress water basins for new projects"". He also advocates for the use of zero-water cooling technologies that are advancing globally, but ""inconsistently deployed across Indian and legacy facilities"". A lesser, but significant concern apart from water, is energy use. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's electricity consumption for data centres is expected to double from 0.5-1% of the country's total power demand to around 1-2%. ""This could mean increased use of fossil fuel-based energy, because right now there is no regulation that forces data centres to use renewable energy,"" says Ms Garg. While many data centres in India have signed contracts with renewable energy companies to mitigate their carbon footprint, formally ""mandating the use of clean energy"" will make this growth more sustainable, she adds. Delhi will clearly have to strike a delicate policy balance as it supercharges its futuristic digital aspirations while also ensuring there's least damage to the environment. ""In the end, we need to ensure that one good is not sacrificed for another,"" says Ms Garg."
China Japan,Trump hints at India visit amid high-stakes trade deal talks ,2025-11-07T06:48:50.732Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1ynv41qyo,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks with India are ""going good"" and also hinted at a possible visit to the country next year. While speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, Trump called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""a friend"" and a ""great man"" and said India had ""largely stopped buying oil from Russia"", a claim he has . Trump had slapped India with 50% tariffs in August, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms, which he says was funding Moscow's war with Ukraine - a charge Delhi denies. Trump's comments come as Delhi and Washington are working to conclude a high-stakes trade deal this fall. Speaking to reporters about a possible visit to India, Trump said, ""we will figure that out, I will go... Prime Minister Modi is a great man and I will be going"". It is unclear when the visit will take place, but it could be next year, Trump said. His remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty about whether the president will join the Quad Summit which India is scheduled to host this year. The Quad  - composed of Japan, the US, Australia and India - aims at boosting the prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific - was slated to meet in India in November. The exact dates for the 2025 summit have yet to be confirmed. While trade talks between India and the US have resumed after months of being stalled over Delhi's Russian oil purchases, India has not directly confirmed Trump's claims of reducing imports. In October, India's oil imports from Russia had risen slightly from the month before, according to preliminary ship data by Reuters. But according to the news agency, major Indian and Chinese refiners have now reduced purchases following fresh US sanctions on Russian producers, which has led to Russian oil trading at a steep discount to Brent crude. India is the second largest importer of Russian crude after China. Russian oil made up 35% to 40% of India's oil imports in 2024 - up from 3% in 2021. Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available oil to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also pointed to ongoing oil trade between Europe and Russia as an example of being selectively targeted for its imports. Along with reducing dependence on Moscow, the Trump administration has been putting pressure on Delhi to buy more oil and gas from the US. An Indian government spokesman had previously said discussions were ""ongoing"" with the US administration which had ""shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India"". While India's oil purchases from Moscow had significantly strained US-India ties, the relationship appears to be on the mend, with Trump previously saying he frequently communicates with his Indian counterpart via phone calls. The two have also publicly expressed their commitment to furthering India-US ties. Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn."
China Japan,Japanese 'One Piece' singer stopped mid-show after China-Japan feud,2025-12-01T08:17:32.333Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c997n2zlegzo,"The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves ""rude"" and ""extreme"". Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members. On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing ""force majeure"". This spate of cancellations come as fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan. While responding to a question in parliament last month, Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries. Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to ""unavoidable circumstances"". ""Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,"" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter. Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after ""comprehensively taking into consideration various factors"", according to Japan's Kyodo News. The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival. Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: ""I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers."" Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given ""the Hu Jintao treatment"". On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. ""What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?"" read an X post written in Japanese. ""Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?"" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. ""It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,"" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. ""Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!"" he wrote. However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. ""How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?"" a Weibo user wrote. Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the ""people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour"" she wrote on Instagram. ""I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,"" she wrote. Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films amid the diplomatic row."
China Japan,Japan movie releases postponed in China after Taiwan row,2025-11-18T03:46:10.752Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93d08jg383o,"The releases of at least two popular Japanese films have been postponed in China amid a dispute over . The delayed releases include Cells at Work! and Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, according to Chinese state media CCTV. Cinema tickets are still available for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, the BBC has confirmed, but CCTV said sales in China had fallen recently as the row deepened. Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested earlier this month that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan - to which the government overthrown by China's communist revolution fled - as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland. Film distributors and importers have decided to postpone the releases after reassessing the overall outlook of Japanese films in China and the sentiment among Chinese audiences, . Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, which is an animated comedy about the adventures of a young boy and his friends, was due to be released in the coming weeks. Cells at Work! - which has also seen its release postponed - is a live action movie based on a manga about human blood cells fighting off viruses. CCTV did not say how long the films' releases will be delayed for. The state-controlled media outlet said Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had faced ""strong dissatisfaction among Chinese audiences"" following Takaichi's remarks. The BBC has contacted the films' distributors, including Japanese media giant Toho. Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on 7 November: ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation."" Beijing has since urged its citizens to avoid travel to Japan and told students to reconsider studying there, citing safety risks. as investors weighed the impact of the China's response. China is a key source of tourism to Japan, with almost 7.5m visitors in the first nine months of this year. Beijing . It has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in support of keeping the status quo in which Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it."

Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its military activities in the region, suggested this month Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Shares in Japanese department stores were hit hard, with the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan chains plunging by almost 12%. Other well-known brands like cosmetics company Shiseido also fell sharply. China has consistently ranked among the top sources of tourists visiting Japan. Shares in department store chain Takashimaya, and  the owner of global fashion chain Uniqlo closed more than 5% lower. Carriers Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings were also down. Shares in Oriental Land, the theme park company that runs the Tokyo Disney resort, ended the day 5.8% lower. The share price falls came after the dispute between Beijing and Tokyo has deepened in recent days. On Sunday, the Chinese government urged its citizens to reconsider studying in Japan, citing risks to their safety and a rise in crimes targeting Chinese people. also told students already based in Japan to closely monitor the security situation. Last year, more than 100,000 Chinese students were enrolled in educational institutions in Japan, according to a Japanese government survey. Also over the weekend, Chinese airlines - including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, and Air China - offered refunds for flights to Japan. Takaichi said in the Japanese parliament on 7 November: ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation."" A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies presents an existential threat to Tokyo. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be called upon to respond to the threat. Taiwan lies just over 100km (62 miles) south of the closest Japanese island. A Kyodo news agency poll published on Sunday suggested that the Japanese public is split on whether the country should exercise its right to self-defence if Beijing attacks Taiwan. Chinese and Japanese officials are expected to hold talks on Tuesday. Chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara said that Beijing's moves are not in line with the ""broader direction confirmed between our leaders"" in promoting a mutually beneficial and stable relationship. that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it."
China Japan,Chinese and Japanese boats face off near disputed islands as feud worsens,2025-12-02T07:26:10.130Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk7xjpv8gmo,"China and Japan's coast guards have given different accounts of a confrontation that occurred near a group of geopolitically sensitive islands in the East China Sea. China's Coast Guard said on Tuesday that a Japanese fishing vessel had illegally entered the waters of the Diaoyu Islands - which Tokyo calls the Senkaku Islands. China claims them as their territory, despite the islands being administered by Japan. Japan's Coast Guard, meanwhile, said it intercepted and expelled two Chinese Coast Guard ships as they approached the fishing vessel. The confrontation comes as , after Japan's leader made controversial comments about Taiwan last month. While responding to a question in parliament in November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards each other, with the widening rift affecting daily life for citizens in both countries. Taiwan is located about 160km south-west of the Senkaku Islands. China Coast Guard (CCG) spokesperson Liu Dejun said that Chinese vessels on Tuesday approached and warned off a Japanese fishing boat that had ""illegally entered the territorial waters of China's Diaoyu Dao"", according to a state media report. Liu added that the CCG took ""necessary law enforcement measures"", claiming that the islands were Chinese territory and urging Japan to ""immediately stop all acts of infringement and provocation in these waters"". The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) offered a slightly different account, saying they approached the Chinese vessels shortly after they were seen entering Japanese waters in the early hours of Tuesday and issued a demand that they leave the waters. The JCG's patrol ship ensured the fishing boat's safety until the CCG left the territory a few hours later, it said. While Japan and China made an in-principle agreement in 2008 to jointly exploit resources in the East China Sea, the waterway that separates the two countries, tensions have escalated over the past decade-and-a-half. The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which are uninhabited, . China has sent an increasing number of ships towards the islands, in what appears to be an attempt to test Japan's resolve to defend them. Last year, the number of days Chinese government vessels were spotted in the territory hit a record high for the third consecutive year. There were also a record number of CCG vessels operating in the waters. Prior to the events of Tuesday morning, the CCG last entered the waters surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands on 16 November, conducting what it described at the time as ""a lawful patrol operation conducted by the China coast guard to uphold its rights and interests""."
China Japan,What to know about China and Japan's escalating spat over Taiwan,2025-11-18T09:54:37.749Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo,"China and Japan have been locked in an escalating row, set off by Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion earlier this month that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. In response, a Chinese diplomat made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. But what began as a war of words has now gone beyond barbs:  Both countries' foreign ministries have since lodged serious protests with each other. Japan has also warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while China urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan. Some Chinese airlines have even offered refunds for flights to Japan. The release of two popular Japanese films in China have also been postponed. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding ""strategic ambiguity"" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan. Here's what you need to know about it: The current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan on 7 November, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan. ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,"" Takaichi responded. A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat. Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as ""egregious"". The following day, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that ""the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off"". While the intent of Xue's remarks ""may not be clear"", they were ""highly inappropriate"", aid Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara. Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's. Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet. Takaichi has declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as ""consistent with the government's traditional position"". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on. Meanwhile, China has turned up the heat on Japan, summoning the Japanese ambassador and repeatedly demanding that Takaichi takes back her words. On social media, China's foreign ministry warned Japan to ""stop playing with fire"" and added that it would be an ""act of aggression"" if Japan ""dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation"". China has urged its citizens ""to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future"" over what it called ""blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan"". This could deal a blow to Japan's tourism industry, which is supported by millions of Chinese visitors every year. Japan's tourism and retail stocks have . For their part, Japanese authorities say their position of supporting ""peaceful resolution"" to issues on Taiwan ""has not changed"". They have also urged China to ""take appropriate action"" over Xue's social media post. This week, the releases of at least , with distributors citing ""sentiments of the domestic audience"", Chinese state media reported. Chinese state media CCTV added that cinema ticket sales for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had also fallen recently. There is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two. This was brought up by a Chinese defence official last week, who said Japan would face ""crushing defeat"" by the Chinese military if it ""failed to draw lessons from history and dared to take reckless risks"". Historical grievances may have long been sore spots in bilateral relations, but the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe suggests more tensions may lie ahead. The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing. Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea. The Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan. This is in line with the policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish. The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security. On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing. In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to ""correct its mistakes"". In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were ""a gross interference in China's internal affairs"". ""Taiwan is China's Taiwan,"" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not ""tolerate any foreign interference"" on the matter. ""What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?"" he added. ""Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?"""
China Japan,India and China trade barbs after passenger detained at Shanghai airport,2025-11-26T07:30:38.416Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9kz127w0o,"The detention of Pema Wangjom Thongdok, an Indian citizen living in the UK, at Shanghai airport has fuelled a diplomatic row between Delhi and Beijing. Ms Thongdok said she was detained by immigration officials while travelling from London to Japan via Shanghai last Friday because her passport lists her birthplace as the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. China disputes India's claim over the region and considers Arunachal its territory, calling it ""South Tibet"" - a claim India firmly rejects. On Tuesday, India it had lodged a protest against Ms Thongdok's detention and reiterated that Arunachal was an ""integral and inalienable"" part of India. Ms Thongdok, who called the experience ""humiliating"", contacted the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing for help. She was released from detention after 18 hours when Indian officials arrived at the airport and spoke to the authorities. India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal called Ms Thongdok's detention ""arbitary"" and said the issued had been taken up strongly with China. ""Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel. Their actions also violate their own regulations that allow visa free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,"" he said in a statement. Mr Jaiswal's statement came hours after China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China's border inspection authorities had ""carried out checks in accordance with laws and regulations"". ""The law enforcement was impartial and non-abusive, the lawful rights of the individual [Ms Thongdok] were fully protected, no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called 'detaining' or 'harassing',"" she told India's PTI news agency. She added that the airline - China Eastern - had provided Ms Thongdok resting facilities and meals. But she insisted that Arunachal was China's territory. ""The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' illegally set up by India,"" she said. The state, which falls along a 3,440km (2,100 mile) de-facto border in the Himalayas - called the Line of Actual Control - has been a source of tension between the Asian neighbours for decades. China says it considers the whole of Arunachal Pradesh its territory, while India claims the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, which is controlled by China. Troops from the countries in Arunachal Pradesh in 2022. The fight took place even as India and China were working to re-establish ties after a clash at the Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region in 2020 led to a complete breakdown in ties. Over the past year or so, India and China have taken some big steps towards normalising relations, including and agreeing on patrolling arrangements to de-escalate border tensions. In August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was in Delhi on a two-day trip, said the neighbours . So, Ms Thongdok's detention amidst these friendly overtures has raised eyebrows in India and made national headlines. She ANI news agency that she had been living in the UK for 14 years and had travelled through Shanghai several times earlier without facing any issues. However, this time an immigration official at the airport ""singled"" her out of the queue and told her that her passport was invalid, she said. ""When I tried to question them and ask them what the issue was, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing and saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian',"" she added."
China Japan,What are small nuclear reactors and why does the UK want to build them? ,2025-11-13T13:14:57.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62614wejk5o,"The UK's first small nuclear power stations will be built on the Isle of Anglesey in north Wales. Back in June, the government promised £2.5bn for small modular reactors (SMRs). It is hoped SMRs will help meet the UK's growing electricity demands, be faster to develop than full size reactors and create thousands of skilled jobs. SMRs, sometimes called ""mini nukes"", work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity. Inside one or more large reactor vessels, atoms of nuclear fuel are split, releasing a large amount of heat. That is used to heat water, which drives a turbine. Essentially, reactors are giant nuclear kettles. SMRs will be a fraction of the size and have up to a third of the generating output of a typical large reactor. The modular element means they will be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station. The aim is to save time and money The government wants a secure, reliable, affordable and low carbon energy system. In 2024, nuclear accounted for 14% of the UK's electricity generation, according to provisional government figures. The aim is to boost that. Along with 30 other countries, the UK has signed . But no new nuclear power station has been built since Sizewell B began operating in 1995. And most of those in operation are due to be retired by the end of the decade. The SMR industry is in its infancy and, around the world, about 80 different designs are being investigated. Only China and Russia have small reactors up and running. The UK government is convinced that, with investment, SMRs will create thousands of jobs and boost manufacturing. Initially though, both government and private investment will be needed to turn the designs into a commercially viable reality. In the US, companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, with their power-hungry data centres, . In June 2025 Great British Energy - Nuclear (GBE-N), a public body with statutory powers to push through the government's nuclear plans, announced Rolls Royce had won a competition to develop and build the first three SMR's in the UK. At the same time the government announced £14.2bn to build a new larger scale reactor, Sizewell C, in Suffolk. In 2011, the Conservative government had earlier identified eight sites for ""new nuclear"" (larger reactors), at Bradwell, Hartlepool, Heysham, Hinkley Point, Oldbury, Sellafield, Sizewell and Wylfa. , Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut planning red tape to make it easier for developers to build smaller nuclear reactors in additional places across the country, old industrial sites, such as former nuclear plants being the preferred areas. The location had to meet certain criteria. No sites would be approved close to airports, military sites or pipelines. Areas valuable for nature or at risk of flooding would also be ruled out. Two decommissioned nuclear facilities become the top runners - Wylfa on Anglesey in north Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. In November 2025 Wylfa was chosen. Wylfa has a nuclear heritage dating back decades which ended in 2025 when its ageing nuclear power plant was closed in 2015. The announcement could provide an economic boost for the area. The Rolls Royce design has to go through multiple levels of scrutiny before it is officially signed off. That final approval is expected late in 2026. The financial controversy around the new large reactor being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset is a perfect example of what the UK is trying to move away from. It is running a decade late and has overspent by billions of pounds. SMRs promise to be quicker, easier and cheaper to build. But while they will eventually be built to order, cost savings don't kick in until designs have been finalised and modules are reliably rolling off factory lines. So the first SMRs will probably be very expensive to build. The cost of dealing with nuclear waste also has to be factored in. Sellafield, in Cumbria, currently deals with most of the country's waste, but it is running out of space and costs are spiralling. any new nuclear power station design should include clear plans for managing waste, to avoid the ""costly mistake of the past"". Taxpayers today are still paying for Sellafield to deal with nuclear waste from the 1950s. Nuclear industry experts the BBC has spoken to are convinced that SMRs - and more nuclear power - will eventually reduce the cost of our electricity supply. Public attitudes to nuclear power appear to be linked to those prices. A government survey in 2024 suggested that 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills. Although for households close to upgraded pylons, there has been no such announcement yet relating to homes near SMRs. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear power plants are among ""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"". Nuclear power's reputation is tarnished though by high profile disasters, where radioactive material has been released into the environment - including in  Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan, in 2011. Dr Simon Middleburgh, a nuclear scientist from Bangor University, whose research focuses on developing new nuclear materials, describes the smaller reactors that are being considered for the UK as ""incredibly safe"". ""The UK's ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation) is treated as a sort of gold standard internationally in terms of the regulatory environment,"" he told BBC News. Some experts do have concerns about nuclear waste. Scientists from the government advisory group recently said the issue of how radioactive waste from SMRs that are in the design stage ""appears, with some exceptions... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed"". The number and location of SMRs is also a security issue. With more reactors spread over a larger area, potentially built on industrial sites and closer to people, Dr Ross Peel, a researcher in civil nuclear security from Kings College London, says the security burden will be higher. Security at nuclear power stations is provided by armed police - the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Dr Peel says the fact that existing nuclear sites generally have ""miles of empty land around them"" means that anyone in the vicinity arouses suspicion. If officers spot anyone they could just ""look through the binoculars and ask 'what are you doing?',"" he said. ""In urban or industrial environments, suddenly you're trying to do security in a very different [way]."""
China Japan,India's data centre boom confronts a looming water challenge,2025-11-09T23:18:30.889Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr417pwek7o,"The extraordinary rise of artificial intelligence has turbocharged data centre growth in India, Asia's third largest economy. Data centres - the centralised physical facilities that enable our growing digital existence by hosting computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment - power everything from ChatGPT queries to electric vehicles and streaming services. Last month, made an eye-popping $15bn (£11.49bn) investment in an AI data centre in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh - its biggest in India. It was the latest among a string of investments from companies - including global giants like Amazon Web Services and Meta and local players such as Reliance Industries - that are pumping billions of dollars into India's data centre market. Even luxury real-estate developers have joined the bandwagon to build these computing facilities. The sector is poised for ""explosive growth"", according to global real estate advisory JLL, with India's data centre capacity projected to surge 77% by 2027 to reach 1.8GW. Some $25-30bn is expected to be spent in capacity expansion by 2030, according to various estimates. While vital for India's developmental needs, the growth of such energy hungry, water-guzzling infrastructure has profound implications for the country's decarbonisation plans. India has no option but to attract big data centre investments, some experts say. While the country is said to account for 20% of global data generation, it has only 3% of global data centre capacity. And demand for such infrastructure is soaring, with India expected to consume the most data in the world by 2028 - higher than developed markets like the US, Europe and even China. This consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use, the government's regulatory thrust on hosting user data locally and rapid adoption of AI, which has greater computing needs. AI chatbots like ChatGPT have their second largest user base in India. There's also a strong business case for Indian policymakers to push for such investments and for global firms to commit the money. According to Kotak Research, ""data centre development cost is one of the lowest in India with only China's cost being lower"", and India's electricity cost is a fraction of the US, UK and Japan. The country also has world-class tech talent suited for the industry's growth. ""Just like we exploited the IT services boom through the 90s and 2000s, this is another opportunity that we can use to our advantage,"" Vibhuti Garg, director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the BBC. This boom has, however, presented policymakers with difficult trade-offs. From and to in the US and , serious concerns have been raised around data centres guzzling excess water for their cooling systems and consuming vast amounts of energy at the cost of local communities. In an energy starved, water-scarce India, these challenges are even more accentuated. According to the World Bank, India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. India's data centre water consumption, meanwhile, is expected to more than double from 150 billion litres in 2025 to 358 billion litres by 2030, putting further pressure on its water table. Moreover, most of India's data centres are concentrated in urban clusters like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru which have strong competing water needs. A potential pushback from locals or a loss of licences to build and operate such centres as a result of growing water stress could hit the industry hard over the long term, experts say. There are already some murmurs of discontent. Advocacy groups like the have raised ""alarm"" over the Andhra Pradesh state government's ""public resource diversion"" for Google's proposed data centre, saying that Visakhapatnam city where it is slated to come up is already facing acute water stress which could intensify as a result of this investment. Google directed the BBC to a document which says that the company uses a ""peer-reviewed context-based water-risk framework"" to evaluate local watershed risk at new sites to guide decision-making on whether to use a freshwater source. While India has explicit policies and regulations that govern data protection and data centre development, zoning, energy use etc, ""water use does not figure prominently in any of these policy groups, and is a significant blind spot that places high risk on the long-term functioning of these centres"", Sahana Goswami of WRI India, a water research organisation, told the BBC. An S&P Global study predicts that 60-80% of India's data centres will face high water stress in this decade itself as a result of limited resource availability. This, in turn, could have a cascading impact on other industries. ""Imagine shutdowns of data centres in peak summer due to lack of water for cooling - how might this impact banking services, medical systems in hospitals using cloud services, transit system operations and more,"" says Ms Goswami. Companies need to bring greater innovation and explore mechanisms to use treated domestic and industrial waste water instead of fighting for this limited resource, experts say. ""India itself has examples of such innovation in the data centre space in Navi Mumbai. Further, various power and textile industries are much ahead in partnering with municipal authorities and water utilities,""  says Ms Goswami. Praveen Ramamurthy, a water recycling expert from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru city, agrees. ""Non-potable or treated water must be made mandatory for cooling needs,"" he told the BBC, adding that India must also select ""low-stress water basins for new projects"". He also advocates for the use of zero-water cooling technologies that are advancing globally, but ""inconsistently deployed across Indian and legacy facilities"". A lesser, but significant concern apart from water, is energy use. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's electricity consumption for data centres is expected to double from 0.5-1% of the country's total power demand to around 1-2%. ""This could mean increased use of fossil fuel-based energy, because right now there is no regulation that forces data centres to use renewable energy,"" says Ms Garg. While many data centres in India have signed contracts with renewable energy companies to mitigate their carbon footprint, formally ""mandating the use of clean energy"" will make this growth more sustainable, she adds. Delhi will clearly have to strike a delicate policy balance as it supercharges its futuristic digital aspirations while also ensuring there's least damage to the environment. ""In the end, we need to ensure that one good is not sacrificed for another,"" says Ms Garg."
China Japan,Trump hints at India visit amid high-stakes trade deal talks ,2025-11-07T06:48:50.732Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1ynv41qyo,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks with India are ""going good"" and also hinted at a possible visit to the country next year. While speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, Trump called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""a friend"" and a ""great man"" and said India had ""largely stopped buying oil from Russia"", a claim he has . Trump had slapped India with 50% tariffs in August, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms, which he says was funding Moscow's war with Ukraine - a charge Delhi denies. Trump's comments come as Delhi and Washington are working to conclude a high-stakes trade deal this fall. Speaking to reporters about a possible visit to India, Trump said, ""we will figure that out, I will go... Prime Minister Modi is a great man and I will be going"". It is unclear when the visit will take place, but it could be next year, Trump said. His remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty about whether the president will join the Quad Summit which India is scheduled to host this year. The Quad  - composed of Japan, the US, Australia and India - aims at boosting the prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific - was slated to meet in India in November. The exact dates for the 2025 summit have yet to be confirmed. While trade talks between India and the US have resumed after months of being stalled over Delhi's Russian oil purchases, India has not directly confirmed Trump's claims of reducing imports. In October, India's oil imports from Russia had risen slightly from the month before, according to preliminary ship data by Reuters. But according to the news agency, major Indian and Chinese refiners have now reduced purchases following fresh US sanctions on Russian producers, which has led to Russian oil trading at a steep discount to Brent crude. India is the second largest importer of Russian crude after China. Russian oil made up 35% to 40% of India's oil imports in 2024 - up from 3% in 2021. Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available oil to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also pointed to ongoing oil trade between Europe and Russia as an example of being selectively targeted for its imports. Along with reducing dependence on Moscow, the Trump administration has been putting pressure on Delhi to buy more oil and gas from the US. An Indian government spokesman had previously said discussions were ""ongoing"" with the US administration which had ""shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India"". While India's oil purchases from Moscow had significantly strained US-India ties, the relationship appears to be on the mend, with Trump previously saying he frequently communicates with his Indian counterpart via phone calls. The two have also publicly expressed their commitment to furthering India-US ties. Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn."
China Japan,"UK most expensive place to develop nuclear power, report says",2025-11-24T10:18:35.226Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq8jneqpdo,"The UK has become the ""most expensive place in the world"" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises ""overly complex"" bureaucracy around the sector. The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a  ""one-stop shop"" for nuclear decisions. A ""radical reset"" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain ""tens of billions"" in costs and reverse the industry's ""decline"" in recent years, the . It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also , which are faster to build than full-size reactors. The taskforce's report said the planning system needed to be streamlined and the risks associated with nuclear energy should be brought in line with the rest of the world It said the UK had excessively risk-averse policies in place, including ""overly conservative"" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers. A ""fragmented"" regulatory system has led to ""conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed"", it said. The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were ""essential to the UK's future"", with the country at risk of missing out on a ""worldwide nuclear renaissance"". Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: ""Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have ""made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear"". Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said. ""Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety."" The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance. ""A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way."" Several major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity. The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world. The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions. Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024. The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and will take several years to come online. Beyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction. The US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme - now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040. In contrast, Germany has , prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen. The development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl.

China Japan,Chinese and Japanese boats face off near disputed islands as feud worsens,2025-12-02T07:26:10.130Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk7xjpv8gmo,"China and Japan's coast guards have given different accounts of a confrontation that occurred near a group of geopolitically sensitive islands in the East China Sea. China's Coast Guard said on Tuesday that a Japanese fishing vessel had illegally entered the waters of the Diaoyu Islands - which Tokyo calls the Senkaku Islands. China claims them as their territory, despite the islands being administered by Japan. Japan's Coast Guard, meanwhile, said it intercepted and expelled two Chinese Coast Guard ships as they approached the fishing vessel. The confrontation comes as , after Japan's leader made controversial comments about Taiwan last month. While responding to a question in parliament in November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards each other, with the widening rift affecting daily life for citizens in both countries. Taiwan is located about 160km south-west of the Senkaku Islands. China Coast Guard (CCG) spokesperson Liu Dejun said that Chinese vessels on Tuesday approached and warned off a Japanese fishing boat that had ""illegally entered the territorial waters of China's Diaoyu Dao"", according to a state media report. Liu added that the CCG took ""necessary law enforcement measures"", claiming that the islands were Chinese territory and urging Japan to ""immediately stop all acts of infringement and provocation in these waters"". The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) offered a slightly different account, saying they approached the Chinese vessels shortly after they were seen entering Japanese waters in the early hours of Tuesday and issued a demand that they leave the waters. The JCG's patrol ship ensured the fishing boat's safety until the CCG left the territory a few hours later, it said. While Japan and China made an in-principle agreement in 2008 to jointly exploit resources in the East China Sea, the waterway that separates the two countries, tensions have escalated over the past decade-and-a-half. The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which are uninhabited, . China has sent an increasing number of ships towards the islands, in what appears to be an attempt to test Japan's resolve to defend them. Last year, the number of days Chinese government vessels were spotted in the territory hit a record high for the third consecutive year. There were also a record number of CCG vessels operating in the waters. Prior to the events of Tuesday morning, the CCG last entered the waters surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands on 16 November, conducting what it described at the time as ""a lawful patrol operation conducted by the China coast guard to uphold its rights and interests""."
China Japan,What to know about China and Japan's escalating spat over Taiwan,2025-11-18T09:54:37.749Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo,"China and Japan have been locked in an escalating row, set off by Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion earlier this month that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. In response, a Chinese diplomat made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. But what began as a war of words has now gone beyond barbs:  Both countries' foreign ministries have since lodged serious protests with each other. Japan has also warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while China urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan. Some Chinese airlines have even offered refunds for flights to Japan. The release of two popular Japanese films in China have also been postponed. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding ""strategic ambiguity"" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan. Here's what you need to know about it: The current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan on 7 November, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan. ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,"" Takaichi responded. A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat. Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as ""egregious"". The following day, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that ""the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off"". While the intent of Xue's remarks ""may not be clear"", they were ""highly inappropriate"", aid Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara. Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's. Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet. Takaichi has declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as ""consistent with the government's traditional position"". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on. Meanwhile, China has turned up the heat on Japan, summoning the Japanese ambassador and repeatedly demanding that Takaichi takes back her words. On social media, China's foreign ministry warned Japan to ""stop playing with fire"" and added that it would be an ""act of aggression"" if Japan ""dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation"". China has urged its citizens ""to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future"" over what it called ""blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan"". This could deal a blow to Japan's tourism industry, which is supported by millions of Chinese visitors every year. Japan's tourism and retail stocks have . For their part, Japanese authorities say their position of supporting ""peaceful resolution"" to issues on Taiwan ""has not changed"". They have also urged China to ""take appropriate action"" over Xue's social media post. This week, the releases of at least , with distributors citing ""sentiments of the domestic audience"", Chinese state media reported. Chinese state media CCTV added that cinema ticket sales for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had also fallen recently. There is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two. This was brought up by a Chinese defence official last week, who said Japan would face ""crushing defeat"" by the Chinese military if it ""failed to draw lessons from history and dared to take reckless risks"". Historical grievances may have long been sore spots in bilateral relations, but the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe suggests more tensions may lie ahead. The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing. Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea. The Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan. This is in line with the policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish. The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security. On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing. In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to ""correct its mistakes"". In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were ""a gross interference in China's internal affairs"". ""Taiwan is China's Taiwan,"" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not ""tolerate any foreign interference"" on the matter. ""What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?"" he added. ""Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?"""
China Japan,India and China trade barbs after passenger detained at Shanghai airport,2025-11-26T07:30:38.416Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9kz127w0o,"The detention of Pema Wangjom Thongdok, an Indian citizen living in the UK, at Shanghai airport has fuelled a diplomatic row between Delhi and Beijing. Ms Thongdok said she was detained by immigration officials while travelling from London to Japan via Shanghai last Friday because her passport lists her birthplace as the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. China disputes India's claim over the region and considers Arunachal its territory, calling it ""South Tibet"" - a claim India firmly rejects. On Tuesday, India it had lodged a protest against Ms Thongdok's detention and reiterated that Arunachal was an ""integral and inalienable"" part of India. Ms Thongdok, who called the experience ""humiliating"", contacted the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing for help. She was released from detention after 18 hours when Indian officials arrived at the airport and spoke to the authorities. India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal called Ms Thongdok's detention ""arbitary"" and said the issued had been taken up strongly with China. ""Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel. Their actions also violate their own regulations that allow visa free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,"" he said in a statement. Mr Jaiswal's statement came hours after China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China's border inspection authorities had ""carried out checks in accordance with laws and regulations"". ""The law enforcement was impartial and non-abusive, the lawful rights of the individual [Ms Thongdok] were fully protected, no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called 'detaining' or 'harassing',"" she told India's PTI news agency. She added that the airline - China Eastern - had provided Ms Thongdok resting facilities and meals. But she insisted that Arunachal was China's territory. ""The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' illegally set up by India,"" she said. The state, which falls along a 3,440km (2,100 mile) de-facto border in the Himalayas - called the Line of Actual Control - has been a source of tension between the Asian neighbours for decades. China says it considers the whole of Arunachal Pradesh its territory, while India claims the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, which is controlled by China. Troops from the countries in Arunachal Pradesh in 2022. The fight took place even as India and China were working to re-establish ties after a clash at the Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region in 2020 led to a complete breakdown in ties. Over the past year or so, India and China have taken some big steps towards normalising relations, including and agreeing on patrolling arrangements to de-escalate border tensions. In August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was in Delhi on a two-day trip, said the neighbours . So, Ms Thongdok's detention amidst these friendly overtures has raised eyebrows in India and made national headlines. She ANI news agency that she had been living in the UK for 14 years and had travelled through Shanghai several times earlier without facing any issues. However, this time an immigration official at the airport ""singled"" her out of the queue and told her that her passport was invalid, she said. ""When I tried to question them and ask them what the issue was, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing and saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian',"" she added."
China Japan,What are small nuclear reactors and why does the UK want to build them? ,2025-11-13T13:14:57.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62614wejk5o,"The UK's first small nuclear power stations will be built on the Isle of Anglesey in north Wales. Back in June, the government promised £2.5bn for small modular reactors (SMRs). It is hoped SMRs will help meet the UK's growing electricity demands, be faster to develop than full size reactors and create thousands of skilled jobs. SMRs, sometimes called ""mini nukes"", work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity. Inside one or more large reactor vessels, atoms of nuclear fuel are split, releasing a large amount of heat. That is used to heat water, which drives a turbine. Essentially, reactors are giant nuclear kettles. SMRs will be a fraction of the size and have up to a third of the generating output of a typical large reactor. The modular element means they will be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station. The aim is to save time and money The government wants a secure, reliable, affordable and low carbon energy system. In 2024, nuclear accounted for 14% of the UK's electricity generation, according to provisional government figures. The aim is to boost that. Along with 30 other countries, the UK has signed . But no new nuclear power station has been built since Sizewell B began operating in 1995. And most of those in operation are due to be retired by the end of the decade. The SMR industry is in its infancy and, around the world, about 80 different designs are being investigated. Only China and Russia have small reactors up and running. The UK government is convinced that, with investment, SMRs will create thousands of jobs and boost manufacturing. Initially though, both government and private investment will be needed to turn the designs into a commercially viable reality. In the US, companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, with their power-hungry data centres, . In June 2025 Great British Energy - Nuclear (GBE-N), a public body with statutory powers to push through the government's nuclear plans, announced Rolls Royce had won a competition to develop and build the first three SMR's in the UK. At the same time the government announced £14.2bn to build a new larger scale reactor, Sizewell C, in Suffolk. In 2011, the Conservative government had earlier identified eight sites for ""new nuclear"" (larger reactors), at Bradwell, Hartlepool, Heysham, Hinkley Point, Oldbury, Sellafield, Sizewell and Wylfa. , Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut planning red tape to make it easier for developers to build smaller nuclear reactors in additional places across the country, old industrial sites, such as former nuclear plants being the preferred areas. The location had to meet certain criteria. No sites would be approved close to airports, military sites or pipelines. Areas valuable for nature or at risk of flooding would also be ruled out. Two decommissioned nuclear facilities become the top runners - Wylfa on Anglesey in north Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. In November 2025 Wylfa was chosen. Wylfa has a nuclear heritage dating back decades which ended in 2025 when its ageing nuclear power plant was closed in 2015. The announcement could provide an economic boost for the area. The Rolls Royce design has to go through multiple levels of scrutiny before it is officially signed off. That final approval is expected late in 2026. The financial controversy around the new large reactor being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset is a perfect example of what the UK is trying to move away from. It is running a decade late and has overspent by billions of pounds. SMRs promise to be quicker, easier and cheaper to build. But while they will eventually be built to order, cost savings don't kick in until designs have been finalised and modules are reliably rolling off factory lines. So the first SMRs will probably be very expensive to build. The cost of dealing with nuclear waste also has to be factored in. Sellafield, in Cumbria, currently deals with most of the country's waste, but it is running out of space and costs are spiralling. any new nuclear power station design should include clear plans for managing waste, to avoid the ""costly mistake of the past"". Taxpayers today are still paying for Sellafield to deal with nuclear waste from the 1950s. Nuclear industry experts the BBC has spoken to are convinced that SMRs - and more nuclear power - will eventually reduce the cost of our electricity supply. Public attitudes to nuclear power appear to be linked to those prices. A government survey in 2024 suggested that 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills. Although for households close to upgraded pylons, there has been no such announcement yet relating to homes near SMRs. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear power plants are among ""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"". Nuclear power's reputation is tarnished though by high profile disasters, where radioactive material has been released into the environment - including in  Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan, in 2011. Dr Simon Middleburgh, a nuclear scientist from Bangor University, whose research focuses on developing new nuclear materials, describes the smaller reactors that are being considered for the UK as ""incredibly safe"". ""The UK's ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation) is treated as a sort of gold standard internationally in terms of the regulatory environment,"" he told BBC News. Some experts do have concerns about nuclear waste. Scientists from the government advisory group recently said the issue of how radioactive waste from SMRs that are in the design stage ""appears, with some exceptions... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed"". The number and location of SMRs is also a security issue. With more reactors spread over a larger area, potentially built on industrial sites and closer to people, Dr Ross Peel, a researcher in civil nuclear security from Kings College London, says the security burden will be higher. Security at nuclear power stations is provided by armed police - the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Dr Peel says the fact that existing nuclear sites generally have ""miles of empty land around them"" means that anyone in the vicinity arouses suspicion. If officers spot anyone they could just ""look through the binoculars and ask 'what are you doing?',"" he said. ""In urban or industrial environments, suddenly you're trying to do security in a very different [way]."""
China Japan,India's data centre boom confronts a looming water challenge,2025-11-09T23:18:30.889Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr417pwek7o,"The extraordinary rise of artificial intelligence has turbocharged data centre growth in India, Asia's third largest economy. Data centres - the centralised physical facilities that enable our growing digital existence by hosting computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment - power everything from ChatGPT queries to electric vehicles and streaming services. Last month, made an eye-popping $15bn (£11.49bn) investment in an AI data centre in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh - its biggest in India. It was the latest among a string of investments from companies - including global giants like Amazon Web Services and Meta and local players such as Reliance Industries - that are pumping billions of dollars into India's data centre market. Even luxury real-estate developers have joined the bandwagon to build these computing facilities. The sector is poised for ""explosive growth"", according to global real estate advisory JLL, with India's data centre capacity projected to surge 77% by 2027 to reach 1.8GW. Some $25-30bn is expected to be spent in capacity expansion by 2030, according to various estimates. While vital for India's developmental needs, the growth of such energy hungry, water-guzzling infrastructure has profound implications for the country's decarbonisation plans. India has no option but to attract big data centre investments, some experts say. While the country is said to account for 20% of global data generation, it has only 3% of global data centre capacity. And demand for such infrastructure is soaring, with India expected to consume the most data in the world by 2028 - higher than developed markets like the US, Europe and even China. This consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use, the government's regulatory thrust on hosting user data locally and rapid adoption of AI, which has greater computing needs. AI chatbots like ChatGPT have their second largest user base in India. There's also a strong business case for Indian policymakers to push for such investments and for global firms to commit the money. According to Kotak Research, ""data centre development cost is one of the lowest in India with only China's cost being lower"", and India's electricity cost is a fraction of the US, UK and Japan. The country also has world-class tech talent suited for the industry's growth. ""Just like we exploited the IT services boom through the 90s and 2000s, this is another opportunity that we can use to our advantage,"" Vibhuti Garg, director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the BBC. This boom has, however, presented policymakers with difficult trade-offs. From and to in the US and , serious concerns have been raised around data centres guzzling excess water for their cooling systems and consuming vast amounts of energy at the cost of local communities. In an energy starved, water-scarce India, these challenges are even more accentuated. According to the World Bank, India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. India's data centre water consumption, meanwhile, is expected to more than double from 150 billion litres in 2025 to 358 billion litres by 2030, putting further pressure on its water table. Moreover, most of India's data centres are concentrated in urban clusters like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru which have strong competing water needs. A potential pushback from locals or a loss of licences to build and operate such centres as a result of growing water stress could hit the industry hard over the long term, experts say. There are already some murmurs of discontent. Advocacy groups like the have raised ""alarm"" over the Andhra Pradesh state government's ""public resource diversion"" for Google's proposed data centre, saying that Visakhapatnam city where it is slated to come up is already facing acute water stress which could intensify as a result of this investment. Google directed the BBC to a document which says that the company uses a ""peer-reviewed context-based water-risk framework"" to evaluate local watershed risk at new sites to guide decision-making on whether to use a freshwater source. While India has explicit policies and regulations that govern data protection and data centre development, zoning, energy use etc, ""water use does not figure prominently in any of these policy groups, and is a significant blind spot that places high risk on the long-term functioning of these centres"", Sahana Goswami of WRI India, a water research organisation, told the BBC. An S&P Global study predicts that 60-80% of India's data centres will face high water stress in this decade itself as a result of limited resource availability. This, in turn, could have a cascading impact on other industries. ""Imagine shutdowns of data centres in peak summer due to lack of water for cooling - how might this impact banking services, medical systems in hospitals using cloud services, transit system operations and more,"" says Ms Goswami. Companies need to bring greater innovation and explore mechanisms to use treated domestic and industrial waste water instead of fighting for this limited resource, experts say. ""India itself has examples of such innovation in the data centre space in Navi Mumbai. Further, various power and textile industries are much ahead in partnering with municipal authorities and water utilities,""  says Ms Goswami. Praveen Ramamurthy, a water recycling expert from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru city, agrees. ""Non-potable or treated water must be made mandatory for cooling needs,"" he told the BBC, adding that India must also select ""low-stress water basins for new projects"". He also advocates for the use of zero-water cooling technologies that are advancing globally, but ""inconsistently deployed across Indian and legacy facilities"". A lesser, but significant concern apart from water, is energy use. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's electricity consumption for data centres is expected to double from 0.5-1% of the country's total power demand to around 1-2%. ""This could mean increased use of fossil fuel-based energy, because right now there is no regulation that forces data centres to use renewable energy,"" says Ms Garg. While many data centres in India have signed contracts with renewable energy companies to mitigate their carbon footprint, formally ""mandating the use of clean energy"" will make this growth more sustainable, she adds. Delhi will clearly have to strike a delicate policy balance as it supercharges its futuristic digital aspirations while also ensuring there's least damage to the environment. ""In the end, we need to ensure that one good is not sacrificed for another,"" says Ms Garg."
China Japan,Trump hints at India visit amid high-stakes trade deal talks ,2025-11-07T06:48:50.732Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1ynv41qyo,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks with India are ""going good"" and also hinted at a possible visit to the country next year. While speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, Trump called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""a friend"" and a ""great man"" and said India had ""largely stopped buying oil from Russia"", a claim he has . Trump had slapped India with 50% tariffs in August, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms, which he says was funding Moscow's war with Ukraine - a charge Delhi denies. Trump's comments come as Delhi and Washington are working to conclude a high-stakes trade deal this fall. Speaking to reporters about a possible visit to India, Trump said, ""we will figure that out, I will go... Prime Minister Modi is a great man and I will be going"". It is unclear when the visit will take place, but it could be next year, Trump said. His remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty about whether the president will join the Quad Summit which India is scheduled to host this year. The Quad  - composed of Japan, the US, Australia and India - aims at boosting the prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific - was slated to meet in India in November. The exact dates for the 2025 summit have yet to be confirmed. While trade talks between India and the US have resumed after months of being stalled over Delhi's Russian oil purchases, India has not directly confirmed Trump's claims of reducing imports. In October, India's oil imports from Russia had risen slightly from the month before, according to preliminary ship data by Reuters. But according to the news agency, major Indian and Chinese refiners have now reduced purchases following fresh US sanctions on Russian producers, which has led to Russian oil trading at a steep discount to Brent crude. India is the second largest importer of Russian crude after China. Russian oil made up 35% to 40% of India's oil imports in 2024 - up from 3% in 2021. Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available oil to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also pointed to ongoing oil trade between Europe and Russia as an example of being selectively targeted for its imports. Along with reducing dependence on Moscow, the Trump administration has been putting pressure on Delhi to buy more oil and gas from the US. An Indian government spokesman had previously said discussions were ""ongoing"" with the US administration which had ""shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India"". While India's oil purchases from Moscow had significantly strained US-India ties, the relationship appears to be on the mend, with Trump previously saying he frequently communicates with his Indian counterpart via phone calls. The two have also publicly expressed their commitment to furthering India-US ties. Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn."
China Japan,"UK most expensive place to develop nuclear power, report says",2025-11-24T10:18:35.226Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq8jneqpdo,"The UK has become the ""most expensive place in the world"" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises ""overly complex"" bureaucracy around the sector. The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a  ""one-stop shop"" for nuclear decisions. A ""radical reset"" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain ""tens of billions"" in costs and reverse the industry's ""decline"" in recent years, the . It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also , which are faster to build than full-size reactors. The taskforce's report said the planning system needed to be streamlined and the risks associated with nuclear energy should be brought in line with the rest of the world It said the UK had excessively risk-averse policies in place, including ""overly conservative"" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers. A ""fragmented"" regulatory system has led to ""conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed"", it said. The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were ""essential to the UK's future"", with the country at risk of missing out on a ""worldwide nuclear renaissance"". Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: ""Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have ""made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear"". Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said. ""Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety."" The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance. ""A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way."" Several major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity. The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world. The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions. Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024. The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and will take several years to come online. Beyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction. The US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme - now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040. In contrast, Germany has , prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen. The development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl. Mike Childs, head of policy for environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, said: ""Nuclear power has always been and will always be extraordinarily expensive, not because of regulation but because of the nature of the technology. ""Investing in energy efficiency, renewable power and energy storage is the economically sensible route to keep energy bills affordable."""
China Japan,Japanese 'One Piece' singer stopped mid-show after China-Japan feud,2025-12-01T08:17:32.333Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c997n2zlegzo,"The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves ""rude"" and ""extreme"". Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members. On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing ""force majeure"". This spate of cancellations come as fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan. While responding to a question in parliament last month, Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries. Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to ""unavoidable circumstances"". ""Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,"" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter. Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after ""comprehensively taking into consideration various factors"", according to Japan's Kyodo News. The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival. Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: ""I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers."" Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given ""the Hu Jintao treatment"". On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. ""What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?"" read an X post written in Japanese. ""Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?"" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. ""It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,"" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. ""Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!"" he wrote. However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. ""How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?"" a Weibo user wrote. Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the ""people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour"" she wrote on Instagram. ""I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,"" she wrote. Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films amid the diplomatic row."

Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested earlier this month that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan - to which the government overthrown by China's communist revolution fled - as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland. Film distributors and importers have decided to postpone the releases after reassessing the overall outlook of Japanese films in China and the sentiment among Chinese audiences, . Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, which is an animated comedy about the adventures of a young boy and his friends, was due to be released in the coming weeks. Cells at Work! - which has also seen its release postponed - is a live action movie based on a manga about human blood cells fighting off viruses. CCTV did not say how long the films' releases will be delayed for. The state-controlled media outlet said Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had faced ""strong dissatisfaction among Chinese audiences"" following Takaichi's remarks. The BBC has contacted the films' distributors, including Japanese media giant Toho. Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on 7 November: ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation.""

Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its military activities in the region, suggested this month Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Shares in Japanese department stores were hit hard, with the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan chains plunging by almost 12%. Other well-known brands like cosmetics company Shiseido also fell sharply. China has consistently ranked among the top sources of tourists visiting Japan. Shares in department store chain Takashimaya, and  the owner of global fashion chain Uniqlo closed more than 5% lower. Carriers Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings were also down. Shares in Oriental Land, the theme park company that runs the Tokyo Disney resort, ended the day 5.8% lower. The share price falls came after the dispute between Beijing and Tokyo has deepened in recent days. On Sunday, the Chinese government urged its citizens to reconsider studying in Japan, citing risks to their safety and a rise in crimes targeting Chinese people. also told students already based in Japan to closely monitor the security situation. Last year, more than 100,000 Chinese students were enrolled in educational institutions in Japan, according to a Japanese government survey. Also over the weekend, Chinese airlines - including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, and Air China - offered refunds for flights to Japan. Takaichi said in the Japanese parliament on 7 November: ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation."" A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies presents an existential threat to Tokyo. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be called upon to respond to the threat. Taiwan lies just over 100km (62 miles) south of the closest Japanese island. A Kyodo news agency poll published on Sunday suggested that the Japanese public is split on whether the country should exercise its right to self-defence if Beijing attacks Taiwan.

China Japan,Chinese and Japanese boats face off near disputed islands as feud worsens,2025-12-02T07:26:10.130Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk7xjpv8gmo,"China and Japan's coast guards have given different accounts of a confrontation that occurred near a group of geopolitically sensitive islands in the East China Sea. China's Coast Guard said on Tuesday that a Japanese fishing vessel had illegally entered the waters of the Diaoyu Islands - which Tokyo calls the Senkaku Islands. China claims them as their territory, despite the islands being administered by Japan. Japan's Coast Guard, meanwhile, said it intercepted and expelled two Chinese Coast Guard ships as they approached the fishing vessel. The confrontation comes as , after Japan's leader made controversial comments about Taiwan last month. While responding to a question in parliament in November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since engaged in increasingly hostile rhetoric towards each other, with the widening rift affecting daily life for citizens in both countries. Taiwan is located about 160km south-west of the Senkaku Islands. China Coast Guard (CCG) spokesperson Liu Dejun said that Chinese vessels on Tuesday approached and warned off a Japanese fishing boat that had ""illegally entered the territorial waters of China's Diaoyu Dao"", according to a state media report. Liu added that the CCG took ""necessary law enforcement measures"", claiming that the islands were Chinese territory and urging Japan to ""immediately stop all acts of infringement and provocation in these waters"". The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) offered a slightly different account, saying they approached the Chinese vessels shortly after they were seen entering Japanese waters in the early hours of Tuesday and issued a demand that they leave the waters. The JCG's patrol ship ensured the fishing boat's safety until the CCG left the territory a few hours later, it said. While Japan and China made an in-principle agreement in 2008 to jointly exploit resources in the East China Sea, the waterway that separates the two countries, tensions have escalated over the past decade-and-a-half. The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which are uninhabited, . China has sent an increasing number of ships towards the islands, in what appears to be an attempt to test Japan's resolve to defend them. Last year, the number of days Chinese government vessels were spotted in the territory hit a record high for the third consecutive year. There were also a record number of CCG vessels operating in the waters. Prior to the events of Tuesday morning, the CCG last entered the waters surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands on 16 November, conducting what it described at the time as ""a lawful patrol operation conducted by the China coast guard to uphold its rights and interests""."
China Japan,What to know about China and Japan's escalating spat over Taiwan,2025-11-18T09:54:37.749Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo,"China and Japan have been locked in an escalating row, set off by Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion earlier this month that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. In response, a Chinese diplomat made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. But what began as a war of words has now gone beyond barbs:  Both countries' foreign ministries have since lodged serious protests with each other. Japan has also warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while China urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan. Some Chinese airlines have even offered refunds for flights to Japan. The release of two popular Japanese films in China have also been postponed. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding ""strategic ambiguity"" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan. Here's what you need to know about it: The current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan on 7 November, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan. ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,"" Takaichi responded. A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat. Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as ""egregious"". The following day, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that ""the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off"". While the intent of Xue's remarks ""may not be clear"", they were ""highly inappropriate"", aid Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara. Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's. Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet. Takaichi has declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as ""consistent with the government's traditional position"". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on. Meanwhile, China has turned up the heat on Japan, summoning the Japanese ambassador and repeatedly demanding that Takaichi takes back her words. On social media, China's foreign ministry warned Japan to ""stop playing with fire"" and added that it would be an ""act of aggression"" if Japan ""dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation"". China has urged its citizens ""to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future"" over what it called ""blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan"". This could deal a blow to Japan's tourism industry, which is supported by millions of Chinese visitors every year. Japan's tourism and retail stocks have . For their part, Japanese authorities say their position of supporting ""peaceful resolution"" to issues on Taiwan ""has not changed"". They have also urged China to ""take appropriate action"" over Xue's social media post. This week, the releases of at least , with distributors citing ""sentiments of the domestic audience"", Chinese state media reported. Chinese state media CCTV added that cinema ticket sales for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had also fallen recently. There is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two. This was brought up by a Chinese defence official last week, who said Japan would face ""crushing defeat"" by the Chinese military if it ""failed to draw lessons from history and dared to take reckless risks"". Historical grievances may have long been sore spots in bilateral relations, but the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe suggests more tensions may lie ahead. The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing. Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea. The Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan. This is in line with the policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish. The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security. On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing. In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to ""correct its mistakes"". In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were ""a gross interference in China's internal affairs"". ""Taiwan is China's Taiwan,"" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not ""tolerate any foreign interference"" on the matter. ""What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?"" he added. ""Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?"""
China Japan,India and China trade barbs after passenger detained at Shanghai airport,2025-11-26T07:30:38.416Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9kz127w0o,"The detention of Pema Wangjom Thongdok, an Indian citizen living in the UK, at Shanghai airport has fuelled a diplomatic row between Delhi and Beijing. Ms Thongdok said she was detained by immigration officials while travelling from London to Japan via Shanghai last Friday because her passport lists her birthplace as the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. China disputes India's claim over the region and considers Arunachal its territory, calling it ""South Tibet"" - a claim India firmly rejects. On Tuesday, India it had lodged a protest against Ms Thongdok's detention and reiterated that Arunachal was an ""integral and inalienable"" part of India. Ms Thongdok, who called the experience ""humiliating"", contacted the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing for help. She was released from detention after 18 hours when Indian officials arrived at the airport and spoke to the authorities. India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal called Ms Thongdok's detention ""arbitary"" and said the issued had been taken up strongly with China. ""Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel. Their actions also violate their own regulations that allow visa free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,"" he said in a statement. Mr Jaiswal's statement came hours after China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China's border inspection authorities had ""carried out checks in accordance with laws and regulations"". ""The law enforcement was impartial and non-abusive, the lawful rights of the individual [Ms Thongdok] were fully protected, no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called 'detaining' or 'harassing',"" she told India's PTI news agency. She added that the airline - China Eastern - had provided Ms Thongdok resting facilities and meals. But she insisted that Arunachal was China's territory. ""The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' illegally set up by India,"" she said. The state, which falls along a 3,440km (2,100 mile) de-facto border in the Himalayas - called the Line of Actual Control - has been a source of tension between the Asian neighbours for decades. China says it considers the whole of Arunachal Pradesh its territory, while India claims the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, which is controlled by China. Troops from the countries in Arunachal Pradesh in 2022. The fight took place even as India and China were working to re-establish ties after a clash at the Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region in 2020 led to a complete breakdown in ties. Over the past year or so, India and China have taken some big steps towards normalising relations, including and agreeing on patrolling arrangements to de-escalate border tensions. In August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was in Delhi on a two-day trip, said the neighbours . So, Ms Thongdok's detention amidst these friendly overtures has raised eyebrows in India and made national headlines. She ANI news agency that she had been living in the UK for 14 years and had travelled through Shanghai several times earlier without facing any issues. However, this time an immigration official at the airport ""singled"" her out of the queue and told her that her passport was invalid, she said. ""When I tried to question them and ask them what the issue was, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing and saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian',"" she added."
China Japan,What are small nuclear reactors and why does the UK want to build them? ,2025-11-13T13:14:57.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62614wejk5o,"The UK's first small nuclear power stations will be built on the Isle of Anglesey in north Wales. Back in June, the government promised £2.5bn for small modular reactors (SMRs). It is hoped SMRs will help meet the UK's growing electricity demands, be faster to develop than full size reactors and create thousands of skilled jobs. SMRs, sometimes called ""mini nukes"", work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity. Inside one or more large reactor vessels, atoms of nuclear fuel are split, releasing a large amount of heat. That is used to heat water, which drives a turbine. Essentially, reactors are giant nuclear kettles. SMRs will be a fraction of the size and have up to a third of the generating output of a typical large reactor. The modular element means they will be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station. The aim is to save time and money The government wants a secure, reliable, affordable and low carbon energy system. In 2024, nuclear accounted for 14% of the UK's electricity generation, according to provisional government figures. The aim is to boost that. Along with 30 other countries, the UK has signed . But no new nuclear power station has been built since Sizewell B began operating in 1995. And most of those in operation are due to be retired by the end of the decade. The SMR industry is in its infancy and, around the world, about 80 different designs are being investigated. Only China and Russia have small reactors up and running. The UK government is convinced that, with investment, SMRs will create thousands of jobs and boost manufacturing. Initially though, both government and private investment will be needed to turn the designs into a commercially viable reality. In the US, companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, with their power-hungry data centres, . In June 2025 Great British Energy - Nuclear (GBE-N), a public body with statutory powers to push through the government's nuclear plans, announced Rolls Royce had won a competition to develop and build the first three SMR's in the UK. At the same time the government announced £14.2bn to build a new larger scale reactor, Sizewell C, in Suffolk. In 2011, the Conservative government had earlier identified eight sites for ""new nuclear"" (larger reactors), at Bradwell, Hartlepool, Heysham, Hinkley Point, Oldbury, Sellafield, Sizewell and Wylfa. , Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut planning red tape to make it easier for developers to build smaller nuclear reactors in additional places across the country, old industrial sites, such as former nuclear plants being the preferred areas. The location had to meet certain criteria. No sites would be approved close to airports, military sites or pipelines. Areas valuable for nature or at risk of flooding would also be ruled out. Two decommissioned nuclear facilities become the top runners - Wylfa on Anglesey in north Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. In November 2025 Wylfa was chosen. Wylfa has a nuclear heritage dating back decades which ended in 2025 when its ageing nuclear power plant was closed in 2015. The announcement could provide an economic boost for the area. The Rolls Royce design has to go through multiple levels of scrutiny before it is officially signed off. That final approval is expected late in 2026. The financial controversy around the new large reactor being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset is a perfect example of what the UK is trying to move away from. It is running a decade late and has overspent by billions of pounds. SMRs promise to be quicker, easier and cheaper to build. But while they will eventually be built to order, cost savings don't kick in until designs have been finalised and modules are reliably rolling off factory lines. So the first SMRs will probably be very expensive to build. The cost of dealing with nuclear waste also has to be factored in. Sellafield, in Cumbria, currently deals with most of the country's waste, but it is running out of space and costs are spiralling. any new nuclear power station design should include clear plans for managing waste, to avoid the ""costly mistake of the past"". Taxpayers today are still paying for Sellafield to deal with nuclear waste from the 1950s. Nuclear industry experts the BBC has spoken to are convinced that SMRs - and more nuclear power - will eventually reduce the cost of our electricity supply. Public attitudes to nuclear power appear to be linked to those prices. A government survey in 2024 suggested that 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills. Although for households close to upgraded pylons, there has been no such announcement yet relating to homes near SMRs. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear power plants are among ""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"". Nuclear power's reputation is tarnished though by high profile disasters, where radioactive material has been released into the environment - including in  Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan, in 2011. Dr Simon Middleburgh, a nuclear scientist from Bangor University, whose research focuses on developing new nuclear materials, describes the smaller reactors that are being considered for the UK as ""incredibly safe"". ""The UK's ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation) is treated as a sort of gold standard internationally in terms of the regulatory environment,"" he told BBC News. Some experts do have concerns about nuclear waste. Scientists from the government advisory group recently said the issue of how radioactive waste from SMRs that are in the design stage ""appears, with some exceptions... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed"". The number and location of SMRs is also a security issue. With more reactors spread over a larger area, potentially built on industrial sites and closer to people, Dr Ross Peel, a researcher in civil nuclear security from Kings College London, says the security burden will be higher. Security at nuclear power stations is provided by armed police - the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Dr Peel says the fact that existing nuclear sites generally have ""miles of empty land around them"" means that anyone in the vicinity arouses suspicion. If officers spot anyone they could just ""look through the binoculars and ask 'what are you doing?',"" he said. ""In urban or industrial environments, suddenly you're trying to do security in a very different [way]."""
China Japan,"UK most expensive place to develop nuclear power, report says",2025-11-24T10:18:35.226Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq8jneqpdo,"The UK has become the ""most expensive place in the world"" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises ""overly complex"" bureaucracy around the sector. The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a  ""one-stop shop"" for nuclear decisions. A ""radical reset"" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain ""tens of billions"" in costs and reverse the industry's ""decline"" in recent years, the . It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also , which are faster to build than full-size reactors. The taskforce's report said the planning system needed to be streamlined and the risks associated with nuclear energy should be brought in line with the rest of the world It said the UK had excessively risk-averse policies in place, including ""overly conservative"" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers. A ""fragmented"" regulatory system has led to ""conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed"", it said. The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were ""essential to the UK's future"", with the country at risk of missing out on a ""worldwide nuclear renaissance"". Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: ""Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have ""made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear"". Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said. ""Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety."" The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance. ""A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way."" Several major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity. The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world. The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions. Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024. The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and will take several years to come online. Beyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction. The US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme - now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040. In contrast, Germany has , prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen. The development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl. Mike Childs, head of policy for environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, said: ""Nuclear power has always been and will always be extraordinarily expensive, not because of regulation but because of the nature of the technology. ""Investing in energy efficiency, renewable power and energy storage is the economically sensible route to keep energy bills affordable."""
China Japan,India's data centre boom confronts a looming water challenge,2025-11-09T23:18:30.889Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr417pwek7o,"The extraordinary rise of artificial intelligence has turbocharged data centre growth in India, Asia's third largest economy. Data centres - the centralised physical facilities that enable our growing digital existence by hosting computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment - power everything from ChatGPT queries to electric vehicles and streaming services. Last month, made an eye-popping $15bn (£11.49bn) investment in an AI data centre in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh - its biggest in India. It was the latest among a string of investments from companies - including global giants like Amazon Web Services and Meta and local players such as Reliance Industries - that are pumping billions of dollars into India's data centre market. Even luxury real-estate developers have joined the bandwagon to build these computing facilities. The sector is poised for ""explosive growth"", according to global real estate advisory JLL, with India's data centre capacity projected to surge 77% by 2027 to reach 1.8GW. Some $25-30bn is expected to be spent in capacity expansion by 2030, according to various estimates. While vital for India's developmental needs, the growth of such energy hungry, water-guzzling infrastructure has profound implications for the country's decarbonisation plans. India has no option but to attract big data centre investments, some experts say. While the country is said to account for 20% of global data generation, it has only 3% of global data centre capacity. And demand for such infrastructure is soaring, with India expected to consume the most data in the world by 2028 - higher than developed markets like the US, Europe and even China. This consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use, the government's regulatory thrust on hosting user data locally and rapid adoption of AI, which has greater computing needs. AI chatbots like ChatGPT have their second largest user base in India. There's also a strong business case for Indian policymakers to push for such investments and for global firms to commit the money. According to Kotak Research, ""data centre development cost is one of the lowest in India with only China's cost being lower"", and India's electricity cost is a fraction of the US, UK and Japan. The country also has world-class tech talent suited for the industry's growth. ""Just like we exploited the IT services boom through the 90s and 2000s, this is another opportunity that we can use to our advantage,"" Vibhuti Garg, director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the BBC. This boom has, however, presented policymakers with difficult trade-offs. From and to in the US and , serious concerns have been raised around data centres guzzling excess water for their cooling systems and consuming vast amounts of energy at the cost of local communities. In an energy starved, water-scarce India, these challenges are even more accentuated. According to the World Bank, India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. India's data centre water consumption, meanwhile, is expected to more than double from 150 billion litres in 2025 to 358 billion litres by 2030, putting further pressure on its water table. Moreover, most of India's data centres are concentrated in urban clusters like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru which have strong competing water needs. A potential pushback from locals or a loss of licences to build and operate such centres as a result of growing water stress could hit the industry hard over the long term, experts say. There are already some murmurs of discontent. Advocacy groups like the have raised ""alarm"" over the Andhra Pradesh state government's ""public resource diversion"" for Google's proposed data centre, saying that Visakhapatnam city where it is slated to come up is already facing acute water stress which could intensify as a result of this investment. Google directed the BBC to a document which says that the company uses a ""peer-reviewed context-based water-risk framework"" to evaluate local watershed risk at new sites to guide decision-making on whether to use a freshwater source. While India has explicit policies and regulations that govern data protection and data centre development, zoning, energy use etc, ""water use does not figure prominently in any of these policy groups, and is a significant blind spot that places high risk on the long-term functioning of these centres"", Sahana Goswami of WRI India, a water research organisation, told the BBC. An S&P Global study predicts that 60-80% of India's data centres will face high water stress in this decade itself as a result of limited resource availability. This, in turn, could have a cascading impact on other industries. ""Imagine shutdowns of data centres in peak summer due to lack of water for cooling - how might this impact banking services, medical systems in hospitals using cloud services, transit system operations and more,"" says Ms Goswami. Companies need to bring greater innovation and explore mechanisms to use treated domestic and industrial waste water instead of fighting for this limited resource, experts say. ""India itself has examples of such innovation in the data centre space in Navi Mumbai. Further, various power and textile industries are much ahead in partnering with municipal authorities and water utilities,""  says Ms Goswami. Praveen Ramamurthy, a water recycling expert from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru city, agrees. ""Non-potable or treated water must be made mandatory for cooling needs,"" he told the BBC, adding that India must also select ""low-stress water basins for new projects"". He also advocates for the use of zero-water cooling technologies that are advancing globally, but ""inconsistently deployed across Indian and legacy facilities"". A lesser, but significant concern apart from water, is energy use. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's electricity consumption for data centres is expected to double from 0.5-1% of the country's total power demand to around 1-2%. ""This could mean increased use of fossil fuel-based energy, because right now there is no regulation that forces data centres to use renewable energy,"" says Ms Garg. While many data centres in India have signed contracts with renewable energy companies to mitigate their carbon footprint, formally ""mandating the use of clean energy"" will make this growth more sustainable, she adds. Delhi will clearly have to strike a delicate policy balance as it supercharges its futuristic digital aspirations while also ensuring there's least damage to the environment. ""In the end, we need to ensure that one good is not sacrificed for another,"" says Ms Garg."
China Japan,Trump hints at India visit amid high-stakes trade deal talks ,2025-11-07T06:48:50.732Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1ynv41qyo,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks with India are ""going good"" and also hinted at a possible visit to the country next year. While speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, Trump called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""a friend"" and a ""great man"" and said India had ""largely stopped buying oil from Russia"", a claim he has . Trump had slapped India with 50% tariffs in August, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms, which he says was funding Moscow's war with Ukraine - a charge Delhi denies. Trump's comments come as Delhi and Washington are working to conclude a high-stakes trade deal this fall. Speaking to reporters about a possible visit to India, Trump said, ""we will figure that out, I will go... Prime Minister Modi is a great man and I will be going"". It is unclear when the visit will take place, but it could be next year, Trump said. His remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty about whether the president will join the Quad Summit which India is scheduled to host this year. The Quad  - composed of Japan, the US, Australia and India - aims at boosting the prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific - was slated to meet in India in November. The exact dates for the 2025 summit have yet to be confirmed. While trade talks between India and the US have resumed after months of being stalled over Delhi's Russian oil purchases, India has not directly confirmed Trump's claims of reducing imports. In October, India's oil imports from Russia had risen slightly from the month before, according to preliminary ship data by Reuters. But according to the news agency, major Indian and Chinese refiners have now reduced purchases following fresh US sanctions on Russian producers, which has led to Russian oil trading at a steep discount to Brent crude. India is the second largest importer of Russian crude after China. Russian oil made up 35% to 40% of India's oil imports in 2024 - up from 3% in 2021. Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available oil to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also pointed to ongoing oil trade between Europe and Russia as an example of being selectively targeted for its imports. Along with reducing dependence on Moscow, the Trump administration has been putting pressure on Delhi to buy more oil and gas from the US. An Indian government spokesman had previously said discussions were ""ongoing"" with the US administration which had ""shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India"". While India's oil purchases from Moscow had significantly strained US-India ties, the relationship appears to be on the mend, with Trump previously saying he frequently communicates with his Indian counterpart via phone calls. The two have also publicly expressed their commitment to furthering India-US ties. Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn."
China Japan,Japanese 'One Piece' singer stopped mid-show after China-Japan feud,2025-12-01T08:17:32.333Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c997n2zlegzo,"The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves ""rude"" and ""extreme"". Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members. On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing ""force majeure"". This spate of cancellations come as fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan. While responding to a question in parliament last month, Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries. Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to ""unavoidable circumstances"". ""Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,"" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter. Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after ""comprehensively taking into consideration various factors"", according to Japan's Kyodo News. The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival. Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: ""I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers."" Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given ""the Hu Jintao treatment"". On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. ""What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?"" read an X post written in Japanese. ""Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?"" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. ""It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,"" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. ""Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!"" he wrote. However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. ""How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?"" a Weibo user wrote. Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the ""people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour"" she wrote on Instagram. ""I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,"" she wrote. Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films amid the diplomatic row."
China Japan,Japan movie releases postponed in China after Taiwan row,2025-11-18T03:46:10.752Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93d08jg383o,"The releases of at least two popular Japanese films have been postponed in China amid a dispute over . The delayed releases include Cells at Work! and Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, according to Chinese state media CCTV. Cinema tickets are still available for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, the BBC has confirmed, but CCTV said sales in China had fallen recently as the row deepened. Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested earlier this month that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan - to which the government overthrown by China's communist revolution fled - as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland. Film distributors and importers have decided to postpone the releases after reassessing the overall outlook of Japanese films in China and the sentiment among Chinese audiences, . Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, which is an animated comedy about the adventures of a young boy and his friends, was due to be released in the coming weeks. Cells at Work! - which has also seen its release postponed - is a live action movie based on a manga about human blood cells fighting off viruses. CCTV did not say how long the films' releases will be delayed for. The state-controlled media outlet said Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had faced ""strong dissatisfaction among Chinese audiences"" following Takaichi's remarks. The BBC has contacted the films' distributors, including Japanese media giant Toho. Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on 7 November: ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation."" Beijing has since urged its citizens to avoid travel to Japan and told students to reconsider studying there, citing safety risks. as investors weighed the impact of the China's response.

Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its military activities in the region, suggested this month Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Shares in Japanese department stores were hit hard, with the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan chains plunging by almost 12%. Other well-known brands like cosmetics company Shiseido also fell sharply. China has consistently ranked among the top sources of tourists visiting Japan. Shares in department store chain Takashimaya, and  the owner of global fashion chain Uniqlo closed more than 5% lower. Carriers Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings were also down. Shares in Oriental Land, the theme park company that runs the Tokyo Disney resort, ended the day 5.8% lower. The share price falls came after the dispute between Beijing and Tokyo has deepened in recent days. On Sunday, the Chinese government urged its citizens to reconsider studying in Japan, citing risks to their safety and a rise in crimes targeting Chinese people. also told students already based in Japan to closely monitor the security situation. Last year, more than 100,000 Chinese students were enrolled in educational institutions in Japan, according to a Japanese government survey. Also over the weekend, Chinese airlines - including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, and Air China - offered refunds for flights to Japan. Takaichi said in the Japanese parliament on 7 November: ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation."" A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies presents an existential threat to Tokyo. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be called upon to respond to the threat. Taiwan lies just over 100km (62 miles) south of the closest Japanese island. A Kyodo news agency poll published on Sunday suggested that the Japanese public is split on whether the country should exercise its right to self-defence if Beijing attacks Taiwan. Chinese and Japanese officials are expected to hold talks on Tuesday.

China Japan,What to know about China and Japan's escalating spat over Taiwan,2025-11-18T09:54:37.749Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo,"China and Japan have been locked in an escalating row, set off by Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion earlier this month that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. In response, a Chinese diplomat made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. But what began as a war of words has now gone beyond barbs:  Both countries' foreign ministries have since lodged serious protests with each other. Japan has also warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while China urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan. Some Chinese airlines have even offered refunds for flights to Japan. The release of two popular Japanese films in China have also been postponed. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding ""strategic ambiguity"" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan. Here's what you need to know about it: The current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan on 7 November, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan. ""If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,"" Takaichi responded. A ""survival-threatening situation"" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat. Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as ""egregious"". The following day, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X.

While the intent of Xue's remarks ""may not be clear"", they were ""highly inappropriate"", aid Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara. Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's. Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet. Takaichi has declined to retract her remarks, which she defended as ""consistent with the government's traditional position"". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on. Meanwhile, China has turned up the heat on Japan, summoning the Japanese ambassador and repeatedly demanding that Takaichi takes back her words. On social media, China's foreign ministry warned Japan to ""stop playing with fire"" and added that it would be an ""act of aggression"" if Japan ""dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation"". China has urged its citizens ""to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future"" over what it called ""blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan"". This could deal a blow to Japan's tourism industry, which is supported by millions of Chinese visitors every year. Japan's tourism and retail stocks have .

Chinese state media CCTV added that cinema ticket sales for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had also fallen recently. There is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two. This was brought up by a Chinese defence official last week, who said Japan would face ""crushing defeat"" by the Chinese military if it ""failed to draw lessons from history and dared to take reckless risks"". Historical grievances may have long been sore spots in bilateral relations, but the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe suggests more tensions may lie ahead. The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing. Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea. The Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan. This is in line with the policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish. The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security. On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing.

Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries. Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to ""unavoidable circumstances"". ""Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,"" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter. Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after ""comprehensively taking into consideration various factors"", according to Japan's Kyodo News. The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival. Asked about the incident at a daily media conference on Monday, a spokesperson from Beijing's foreign ministry told reporters: ""I suggest you chat with the Chinese organisers."" Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given ""the Hu Jintao treatment"". On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. ""What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?"" read an X post written in Japanese. ""Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?"" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. ""It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,"" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. ""Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!"" he wrote. However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. ""How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?"" a Weibo user wrote. Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the ""people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour"" she wrote on Instagram. ""I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,"" she wrote. Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films amid the diplomatic row."

China Japan,India and China trade barbs after passenger detained at Shanghai airport,2025-11-26T07:30:38.416Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e9kz127w0o,"The detention of Pema Wangjom Thongdok, an Indian citizen living in the UK, at Shanghai airport has fuelled a diplomatic row between Delhi and Beijing. Ms Thongdok said she was detained by immigration officials while travelling from London to Japan via Shanghai last Friday because her passport lists her birthplace as the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. China disputes India's claim over the region and considers Arunachal its territory, calling it ""South Tibet"" - a claim India firmly rejects. On Tuesday, India it had lodged a protest against Ms Thongdok's detention and reiterated that Arunachal was an ""integral and inalienable"" part of India. Ms Thongdok, who called the experience ""humiliating"", contacted the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing for help. She was released from detention after 18 hours when Indian officials arrived at the airport and spoke to the authorities. India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal called Ms Thongdok's detention ""arbitary"" and said the issued had been taken up strongly with China. ""Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel. Their actions also violate their own regulations that allow visa free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,"" he said in a statement. Mr Jaiswal's statement came hours after China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China's border inspection authorities had ""carried out checks in accordance with laws and regulations"". ""The law enforcement was impartial and non-abusive, the lawful rights of the individual [Ms Thongdok] were fully protected, no compulsory measures were taken on her, and there was no so-called 'detaining' or 'harassing',"" she told India's PTI news agency. She added that the airline - China Eastern - had provided Ms Thongdok resting facilities and meals. But she insisted that Arunachal was China's territory. ""The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' illegally set up by India,"" she said. The state, which falls along a 3,440km (2,100 mile) de-facto border in the Himalayas - called the Line of Actual Control - has been a source of tension between the Asian neighbours for decades. China says it considers the whole of Arunachal Pradesh its territory, while India claims the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, which is controlled by China. Troops from the countries in Arunachal Pradesh in 2022. The fight took place even as India and China were working to re-establish ties after a clash at the Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region in 2020 led to a complete breakdown in ties. Over the past year or so, India and China have taken some big steps towards normalising relations, including and agreeing on patrolling arrangements to de-escalate border tensions. In August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was in Delhi on a two-day trip, said the neighbours . So, Ms Thongdok's detention amidst these friendly overtures has raised eyebrows in India and made national headlines. She ANI news agency that she had been living in the UK for 14 years and had travelled through Shanghai several times earlier without facing any issues. However, this time an immigration official at the airport ""singled"" her out of the queue and told her that her passport was invalid, she said. ""When I tried to question them and ask them what the issue was, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing and saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian',"" she added."
China Japan,India's data centre boom confronts a looming water challenge,2025-11-09T23:18:30.889Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr417pwek7o,"The extraordinary rise of artificial intelligence has turbocharged data centre growth in India, Asia's third largest economy. Data centres - the centralised physical facilities that enable our growing digital existence by hosting computer servers, IT infrastructure and network equipment - power everything from ChatGPT queries to electric vehicles and streaming services. Last month, made an eye-popping $15bn (£11.49bn) investment in an AI data centre in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh - its biggest in India. It was the latest among a string of investments from companies - including global giants like Amazon Web Services and Meta and local players such as Reliance Industries - that are pumping billions of dollars into India's data centre market. Even luxury real-estate developers have joined the bandwagon to build these computing facilities. The sector is poised for ""explosive growth"", according to global real estate advisory JLL, with India's data centre capacity projected to surge 77% by 2027 to reach 1.8GW. Some $25-30bn is expected to be spent in capacity expansion by 2030, according to various estimates. While vital for India's developmental needs, the growth of such energy hungry, water-guzzling infrastructure has profound implications for the country's decarbonisation plans. India has no option but to attract big data centre investments, some experts say. While the country is said to account for 20% of global data generation, it has only 3% of global data centre capacity. And demand for such infrastructure is soaring, with India expected to consume the most data in the world by 2028 - higher than developed markets like the US, Europe and even China. This consumption is being driven by massive growth in internet and mobile use, the government's regulatory thrust on hosting user data locally and rapid adoption of AI, which has greater computing needs. AI chatbots like ChatGPT have their second largest user base in India. There's also a strong business case for Indian policymakers to push for such investments and for global firms to commit the money. According to Kotak Research, ""data centre development cost is one of the lowest in India with only China's cost being lower"", and India's electricity cost is a fraction of the US, UK and Japan. The country also has world-class tech talent suited for the industry's growth. ""Just like we exploited the IT services boom through the 90s and 2000s, this is another opportunity that we can use to our advantage,"" Vibhuti Garg, director for South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the BBC. This boom has, however, presented policymakers with difficult trade-offs. From and to in the US and , serious concerns have been raised around data centres guzzling excess water for their cooling systems and consuming vast amounts of energy at the cost of local communities. In an energy starved, water-scarce India, these challenges are even more accentuated. According to the World Bank, India has 18% of the world's population, but only 4% of its water resources, making it among the most water-stressed countries in the world. India's data centre water consumption, meanwhile, is expected to more than double from 150 billion litres in 2025 to 358 billion litres by 2030, putting further pressure on its water table. Moreover, most of India's data centres are concentrated in urban clusters like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru which have strong competing water needs. A potential pushback from locals or a loss of licences to build and operate such centres as a result of growing water stress could hit the industry hard over the long term, experts say. There are already some murmurs of discontent. Advocacy groups like the have raised ""alarm"" over the Andhra Pradesh state government's ""public resource diversion"" for Google's proposed data centre, saying that Visakhapatnam city where it is slated to come up is already facing acute water stress which could intensify as a result of this investment. Google directed the BBC to a document which says that the company uses a ""peer-reviewed context-based water-risk framework"" to evaluate local watershed risk at new sites to guide decision-making on whether to use a freshwater source. While India has explicit policies and regulations that govern data protection and data centre development, zoning, energy use etc, ""water use does not figure prominently in any of these policy groups, and is a significant blind spot that places high risk on the long-term functioning of these centres"", Sahana Goswami of WRI India, a water research organisation, told the BBC. An S&P Global study predicts that 60-80% of India's data centres will face high water stress in this decade itself as a result of limited resource availability. This, in turn, could have a cascading impact on other industries. ""Imagine shutdowns of data centres in peak summer due to lack of water for cooling - how might this impact banking services, medical systems in hospitals using cloud services, transit system operations and more,"" says Ms Goswami. Companies need to bring greater innovation and explore mechanisms to use treated domestic and industrial waste water instead of fighting for this limited resource, experts say. ""India itself has examples of such innovation in the data centre space in Navi Mumbai. Further, various power and textile industries are much ahead in partnering with municipal authorities and water utilities,""  says Ms Goswami. Praveen Ramamurthy, a water recycling expert from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru city, agrees. ""Non-potable or treated water must be made mandatory for cooling needs,"" he told the BBC, adding that India must also select ""low-stress water basins for new projects"". He also advocates for the use of zero-water cooling technologies that are advancing globally, but ""inconsistently deployed across Indian and legacy facilities"". A lesser, but significant concern apart from water, is energy use. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's electricity consumption for data centres is expected to double from 0.5-1% of the country's total power demand to around 1-2%. ""This could mean increased use of fossil fuel-based energy, because right now there is no regulation that forces data centres to use renewable energy,"" says Ms Garg. While many data centres in India have signed contracts with renewable energy companies to mitigate their carbon footprint, formally ""mandating the use of clean energy"" will make this growth more sustainable, she adds. Delhi will clearly have to strike a delicate policy balance as it supercharges its futuristic digital aspirations while also ensuring there's least damage to the environment. ""In the end, we need to ensure that one good is not sacrificed for another,"" says Ms Garg."
China Japan,Trump hints at India visit amid high-stakes trade deal talks ,2025-11-07T06:48:50.732Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x1ynv41qyo,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks with India are ""going good"" and also hinted at a possible visit to the country next year. While speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, Trump called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""a friend"" and a ""great man"" and said India had ""largely stopped buying oil from Russia"", a claim he has . Trump had slapped India with 50% tariffs in August, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil and arms, which he says was funding Moscow's war with Ukraine - a charge Delhi denies. Trump's comments come as Delhi and Washington are working to conclude a high-stakes trade deal this fall. Speaking to reporters about a possible visit to India, Trump said, ""we will figure that out, I will go... Prime Minister Modi is a great man and I will be going"". It is unclear when the visit will take place, but it could be next year, Trump said. His remarks come amid ongoing uncertainty about whether the president will join the Quad Summit which India is scheduled to host this year. The Quad  - composed of Japan, the US, Australia and India - aims at boosting the prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific - was slated to meet in India in November. The exact dates for the 2025 summit have yet to be confirmed. While trade talks between India and the US have resumed after months of being stalled over Delhi's Russian oil purchases, India has not directly confirmed Trump's claims of reducing imports. In October, India's oil imports from Russia had risen slightly from the month before, according to preliminary ship data by Reuters. But according to the news agency, major Indian and Chinese refiners have now reduced purchases following fresh US sanctions on Russian producers, which has led to Russian oil trading at a steep discount to Brent crude. India is the second largest importer of Russian crude after China. Russian oil made up 35% to 40% of India's oil imports in 2024 - up from 3% in 2021. Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available oil to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also pointed to ongoing oil trade between Europe and Russia as an example of being selectively targeted for its imports. Along with reducing dependence on Moscow, the Trump administration has been putting pressure on Delhi to buy more oil and gas from the US. An Indian government spokesman had previously said discussions were ""ongoing"" with the US administration which had ""shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India"". While India's oil purchases from Moscow had significantly strained US-India ties, the relationship appears to be on the mend, with Trump previously saying he frequently communicates with his Indian counterpart via phone calls. The two have also publicly expressed their commitment to furthering India-US ties. Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn."
China Japan,What are small nuclear reactors and why does the UK want to build them? ,2025-11-13T13:14:57.190Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62614wejk5o,"The UK's first small nuclear power stations will be built on the Isle of Anglesey in north Wales. Back in June, the government promised £2.5bn for small modular reactors (SMRs). It is hoped SMRs will help meet the UK's growing electricity demands, be faster to develop than full size reactors and create thousands of skilled jobs. SMRs, sometimes called ""mini nukes"", work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity. Inside one or more large reactor vessels, atoms of nuclear fuel are split, releasing a large amount of heat. That is used to heat water, which drives a turbine. Essentially, reactors are giant nuclear kettles. SMRs will be a fraction of the size and have up to a third of the generating output of a typical large reactor. The modular element means they will be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station. The aim is to save time and money The government wants a secure, reliable, affordable and low carbon energy system. In 2024, nuclear accounted for 14% of the UK's electricity generation, according to provisional government figures. The aim is to boost that. Along with 30 other countries, the UK has signed . But no new nuclear power station has been built since Sizewell B began operating in 1995. And most of those in operation are due to be retired by the end of the decade. The SMR industry is in its infancy and, around the world, about 80 different designs are being investigated. Only China and Russia have small reactors up and running. The UK government is convinced that, with investment, SMRs will create thousands of jobs and boost manufacturing. Initially though, both government and private investment will be needed to turn the designs into a commercially viable reality. In the US, companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, with their power-hungry data centres, . In June 2025 Great British Energy - Nuclear (GBE-N), a public body with statutory powers to push through the government's nuclear plans, announced Rolls Royce had won a competition to develop and build the first three SMR's in the UK. At the same time the government announced £14.2bn to build a new larger scale reactor, Sizewell C, in Suffolk. In 2011, the Conservative government had earlier identified eight sites for ""new nuclear"" (larger reactors), at Bradwell, Hartlepool, Heysham, Hinkley Point, Oldbury, Sellafield, Sizewell and Wylfa. , Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would cut planning red tape to make it easier for developers to build smaller nuclear reactors in additional places across the country, old industrial sites, such as former nuclear plants being the preferred areas. The location had to meet certain criteria. No sites would be approved close to airports, military sites or pipelines. Areas valuable for nature or at risk of flooding would also be ruled out. Two decommissioned nuclear facilities become the top runners - Wylfa on Anglesey in north Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. In November 2025 Wylfa was chosen. Wylfa has a nuclear heritage dating back decades which ended in 2025 when its ageing nuclear power plant was closed in 2015. The announcement could provide an economic boost for the area. The Rolls Royce design has to go through multiple levels of scrutiny before it is officially signed off. That final approval is expected late in 2026. The financial controversy around the new large reactor being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset is a perfect example of what the UK is trying to move away from. It is running a decade late and has overspent by billions of pounds. SMRs promise to be quicker, easier and cheaper to build. But while they will eventually be built to order, cost savings don't kick in until designs have been finalised and modules are reliably rolling off factory lines. So the first SMRs will probably be very expensive to build. The cost of dealing with nuclear waste also has to be factored in. Sellafield, in Cumbria, currently deals with most of the country's waste, but it is running out of space and costs are spiralling. any new nuclear power station design should include clear plans for managing waste, to avoid the ""costly mistake of the past"". Taxpayers today are still paying for Sellafield to deal with nuclear waste from the 1950s. Nuclear industry experts the BBC has spoken to are convinced that SMRs - and more nuclear power - will eventually reduce the cost of our electricity supply. Public attitudes to nuclear power appear to be linked to those prices. A government survey in 2024 suggested that 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills. Although for households close to upgraded pylons, there has been no such announcement yet relating to homes near SMRs. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear power plants are among ""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"". Nuclear power's reputation is tarnished though by high profile disasters, where radioactive material has been released into the environment - including in  Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan, in 2011. Dr Simon Middleburgh, a nuclear scientist from Bangor University, whose research focuses on developing new nuclear materials, describes the smaller reactors that are being considered for the UK as ""incredibly safe"". ""The UK's ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation) is treated as a sort of gold standard internationally in terms of the regulatory environment,"" he told BBC News. Some experts do have concerns about nuclear waste. Scientists from the government advisory group recently said the issue of how radioactive waste from SMRs that are in the design stage ""appears, with some exceptions... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed"". The number and location of SMRs is also a security issue. With more reactors spread over a larger area, potentially built on industrial sites and closer to people, Dr Ross Peel, a researcher in civil nuclear security from Kings College London, says the security burden will be higher. Security at nuclear power stations is provided by armed police - the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Dr Peel says the fact that existing nuclear sites generally have ""miles of empty land around them"" means that anyone in the vicinity arouses suspicion. If officers spot anyone they could just ""look through the binoculars and ask 'what are you doing?',"" he said. ""In urban or industrial environments, suddenly you're trying to do security in a very different [way]."""
China Japan,"UK most expensive place to develop nuclear power, report says",2025-11-24T10:18:35.226Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq8jneqpdo,"The UK has become the ""most expensive place in the world"" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises ""overly complex"" bureaucracy around the sector. The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a  ""one-stop shop"" for nuclear decisions. A ""radical reset"" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain ""tens of billions"" in costs and reverse the industry's ""decline"" in recent years, the . It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also , which are faster to build than full-size reactors. The taskforce's report said the planning system needed to be streamlined and the risks associated with nuclear energy should be brought in line with the rest of the world It said the UK had excessively risk-averse policies in place, including ""overly conservative"" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers. A ""fragmented"" regulatory system has led to ""conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed"", it said. The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were ""essential to the UK's future"", with the country at risk of missing out on a ""worldwide nuclear renaissance"". Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: ""Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have ""made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear"". Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said. ""Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety."" The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance. ""A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way."" Several major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity. The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world. The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions. Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024. The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and will take several years to come online. Beyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction. The US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme - now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040. In contrast, Germany has , prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen. The development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl. Mike Childs, head of policy for environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, said: ""Nuclear power has always been and will always be extraordinarily expensive, not because of regulation but because of the nature of the technology. ""Investing in energy efficiency, renewable power and energy storage is the economically sensible route to keep energy bills affordable."""
