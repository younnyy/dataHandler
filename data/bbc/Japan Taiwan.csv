Japan Taiwan,"Japan's same-sex marriage ban is constitutional, says Tokyo court",2025-11-28T07:57:44.610Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz7njqwvvo,"A Japanese court has ruled the country's ban on same-sex marriage as  constitutional - bucking a trend set by courts around the country that had raised hopes for marriage equality in Japan. The ruling was met with disappointment from plaintiffs and their legal team who had gathered outside the Tokyo courthouse. Japan is the only G7 country that does not fully recognise same-sex couples or offer them clear legal protection. But it's not an outlier in Asia, where only Taiwan, Thailand and Nepal offer same-sex marriages. Ayumi Higashi, the judge who delivered the verdict, said laws on same-sex marriage should first be deliberated in parliament, the newspaper Mainichi reported. Outside the Tokyo courthouse on Friday, the plaintiffs of the lawsuit and their legal team held up signs that read ""unjust verdict"", local media reported. Shino Kawachi, one of the plaintiffs, told local media that the ruling was ""difficult to comprehend"". ""What is justice? Was the court even watching us? Were they considering the next generation?"" she told local media. Her partner, Hiromi Hatogai, said she was ""extremely outraged"" and wondered if the judiciary was ""on our side"". But, she added, they would ""keep fighting"". Amnesty International described the ruling as a ""damaging step backwards on same-sex marriage"". ""The Japanese government needs to be proactive in moving towards the legalisation of same-sex marriage so that couples can fully enjoy the same marriage rights as their heterosexual counterparts,"" the rights group's East Asia researcher Boram Jang said in a statement. The verdict on Friday is the last among six high court rulings on same-sex marriage lawsuits filed between 2019 and 2021, in courts across the country from Sapporo to Osaka to Fukuoka. Among them, five found the ban unconstitutional - though they rejected the plaintiffs' compensation claims. Friday's ruling by the Tokyo high court marks an exception to this series of verdicts, which had been adding weight to the push for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Japan. The cases will next be taken to the Supreme Court."
Japan Taiwan,"New US security strategy aligns with Russia's vision, Moscow says",2025-12-07T15:55:51.169Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvd01g2kwwo,"Russia has welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it ""largely consistent"" with Moscow's vision. The 33-page document, , suggests Europe is facing ""civilisational erasure"" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of ""censorship"" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. ""The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. ""We consider this a positive step,"" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must ""re-establish strategic stability to Russia"" which would ""stabilise European economies"". It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise ""resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations"". The new report also calls for the restoration of ""Western identity"", and claims that Europe will be ""unrecognisable in 20 years or less"" and its economic issues are ""eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure"". ""It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,"" the document states. In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of ""patriotic European parties"" and says ""America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit"". As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising ""questions"" over the document. ""The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,"" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Friday. ""I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.""
