China US Taiwan,Taiwan bans Chinese app RedNote over fraud concerns,2025-12-05T04:56:16.499Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dz0l4j9zeo,"Taiwan says it will block access to popular Chinese social media app RedNote or Xiaohongshu for one year following concerns over online shopping scams. The island's Criminal Investigation Bureau said Thursday it detected more than 1,700 fraud cases on the app since last year, with total losses worth more than NT$247m (£5.9m; $7.9m), local media report. The app is a TikTok-like platform with built-in shopping features. Taiwan's internet service providers have been ordered to block access to the app, affecting at least three million domestic users, according to local reports. The BBC has contacted Xiaohongshu and Taiwanese authorities for comment. BBC checks in Taiwan showed that the platform is no longer accessible to some users. Instead, the app displays a message stating it is unavailable due to ""security restrictions."" said that the app is being banned over a spate of fraud cases and after failing to meet data security standards, putting users at risk. The app's operators do not have a local office and has not responded to regulators' request to submit a plan to improve its cyber-security measures, Taipei Times quoted Taiwan's interior minister as saying. Xiaohongshu, which launched in 2013, has hundreds of millions of users worldwide, and is especially popular in Asia. The app's user-base grew this year as users in America after the government in the US. Taiwan's temporary ban comes as concerns grow over Beijing's use of social media to cultivate more favourable views of China and to spread disinformation. that will eventually be returned to Chinese control. China has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal. Xiaohongshu has also faced pressure from Chinese regulators, which said in September that it has called for ""strict punishment"" on the firm's bosses over ."
China US Taiwan,Typhoon moves away from Philippines after killing two,2025-11-10T03:16:42.357Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykp36ewkzo,"A weakened Typhoon Fung-wong is now passing over the South China Sea and expected to head to Taiwan, after leaving two people dead in the Philippines. Some 1.4 million in the Philippines had been preemptively evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall on Sunday as a super typhoon, carrying winds of 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). It hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT) and weakened to a typhoon hours later. Fung-wong comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left nearly 200 people dead. Philippine authorities are reporting less severe damage than expected - though a number of communities are still cut off by the floods. By daybreak, the winds from Typhoon Fung-wong which had howled all night had died down, and people came out to see the damage. There was plenty of damage to buildings, but good preparation appears to have prevented a repeat of the casualties seen after Kalmaegi hit the central Philippines last week. The country's meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and ""high risk of life-threatening"" storm surges from the ""very intense"" typhoon. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, buildings were secured and residents in low-lying and coastal areas had been urged to move to higher ground. At a shelter in central Aurora, parents brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. ""We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,"" Jessa Zurbano had earlier told the BBC. Another evacuee Patry Azul said: ""Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe."" The winds Fung-wong brought were not as strong as in some previous storms, and its destructive power quickly weakened after it made landfall. Two deaths were reported, according to the civil defence office: one person drowned, while another woman was found dead under debris in Catbalogan City. Two others were injured. Still, many neighbourhoods have been flooded, and some are now isolated from the rest of the country after roads and bridges were cut by the high water levels. Aurora officials told local media on Monday that four towns have been blocked. Power is down in much of the main island of Luzon. The Filipino government had declared a state of calamity across the country in preparation for Typhoon Fung-wong and in the wake of Kalmaegi. This gives government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services. Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year, left at least 204 people dead in the Philippines, while more than 100 are missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones. About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide. However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - . That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding. Are you in the Philippines? If so you can"
