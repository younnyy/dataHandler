China-US Relations,"Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in Delhi",2025-12-04T14:56:51.122Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q2vpggr9o,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries. Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil. It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war. India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet. Why are relations with India key for the Kremlin? Well, for a start, look at the numbers: That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil. India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian. That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market. India was happy. Washington less so. Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying. For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers. But there's geopolitics at play, too. The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed. Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that. So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a ""multi-polar world"". Russia lauds its ""no limits partnership"" with China. It is just as vocal about its ""special and privileged strategic partnership"" with India. That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union. ""I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,"" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov. ""We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy. ""But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India."" This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi. Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions. India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape. Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him. As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict. This was India's ""strategic autonomy"" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time. That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here. Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his ""true friend"". But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine. And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe. ""For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,"" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank. Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia. Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades. Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct. With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade. Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing. But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets. India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix. Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible. But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin. Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance. ""Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,"" GTRI said. Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy. He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West. ""Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,"" GTRI said."
China-US Relations,Thai king becomes country's first monarch to visit China,2025-11-13T09:09:02.801Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l750p7y5no,"King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand has arrived in China on Thursday, the first ever visit by a reigning Thai monarch. The visit is at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping to celebrate the 50th anniversary of both countries establishing diplomatic ties for the first time in 1975. China is believed to have been pushing for this visit for some years. The Thai government said in a statement that the trip ""underlines the deep-rooted friendship and mutual understanding shared between Thailand and China at all levels"". In Beijing, the king and his wife Queen Suthida will visit local landmarks like the Lingguang Buddhist Temple and the Beijing Aerospace City. President Xi and his wife will also host a state banquet for the Thai royals. This is the first major state visit by King Vajiralongkorn since he came to the throne nine years ago – in April he also made a trip to Bhutan. By contrast the most high-profile overseas trips made by his father King Bhumibol were to the United States in the 1960s, when Thailand was feted as a crucial Cold War partner, and a vital base for US military operations in Indochina. Thailand is still officially a military ally of the US, but relations with China have grown steadily closer in recent years, while those with Washington have been frayed by US criticism of human rights in Thailand, by President Trump's tariffs, and a perception that the US is no longer as committed as it once was to its Asian friends. China is Thailand's biggest trading partner, and increasingly a rival to the US as a source of military equipment. Many Thais can trace their ancestry to migrants who came from China, and the Chinese government often highlights what it calls their ""brotherly"" or ""family"" relations. The importance of those ties to Thailand was underlined earlier this year when the Thai authorities deported 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers back to China, in defiance of a warning not to do so by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Then in August an exhibition at Bangkok's main arts centre featuring Uyghur and Tibetan artists was censored following complaints by Chinese diplomats. The Thai government was spurred by Chinese pressure into taking action against scam compounds operating along its border with Myanmar, and objections by China are presumed to have been one of the factors which blocked a proposal to legalise casinos in Thailand. Despite the lack of a Thai royal visit before this one, the Thai monarchy has played a significant role in sustaining Thai-Chinese relations through the work of the king's younger sister, Princess Sirindhorn, who has studied Chinese art and language for the past 45 years, and been a frequent visitor to China."
China-US Relations,A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree,2025-11-17T23:01:18.831Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o,"Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications. But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. ""Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'"" he remembers. ""I was astonished!"" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret. But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: ""There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence."" The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA. Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale. Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment. High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018. Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent. ""For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,"" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. ""And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses."" AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China. A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the . The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access. AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries. ""China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,"" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities. ""The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,"" Mr Shih says. ""This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis."" Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025. In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China. Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it ""stayed very much alive"" as a guiding strategy. ""There are all kinds of plans still being published,"" he says, ""including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan."" At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating ""high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement"" until 2030. AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how . The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA. AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy. ""At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,"" he says. ""I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen."" However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts. ""The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,"" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC. ""Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation."" China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment. In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company. It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech. Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company. That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing. Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets. Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past. ""We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,"" she says. ""Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this."" Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China. ""There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,"" she says. ""Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe."" If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over? ""No! There's gonna be multiple laps,"" maintains Brad Parks. ""There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital. ""So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. ""They're going to move from defence to offence."""
China-US Relations,Trump administration says Europe faces 'civilisational erasure',2025-12-05T12:07:34.641Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04vdengk3do,"US President Donald Trump's administration has warned that Europe faces ""civilisational erasure"" and questioned whether certain nations can remain reliable allies, in a new strategy document that puts a particular focus on the continent. The 33-page National Security Strategy sees the US leader outline his vision for the world and how he will wield US military and economic power to work towards it. Trump described the document as a ""roadmap"" to ensure the US remains ""the greatest and most successful nation in human history"". European politicians have begun to react, with Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying his country did not need ""outside advice"". A formal National Security Strategy is typically released by presidents once per term. It can form a framework for future policies and budgets, as well as signalling to the world where the president's priorities lie. The new document follows similar rhetoric to earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy. The new report doubles down on Trump's point of view, calling for the restoration of ""Western identity"", combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and focusing more on US priorities such as stopping drug cartels. Focusing on Europe, it asserts that if current trends continue the continent would be ""unrecognisable in 20 years or less"" and its economic issues are ""eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure"". ""It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,"" the document states. It also accused the EU and ""other transnational bodies"" of carrying out activities that ""undermine political liberty and sovereignty"". It said migration policies were ""creating strife"" and that other issues included ""censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence"". Conversely, the document hails the growing influence of ""patriotic European parties"" and says ""America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit"". The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been . Germany's Wadephul stressed that the ""United States is and will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance"", but said ""this alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues"". ""I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany,"" he added. Referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the document says Europe has a lack of ""self-confidence"" in its relationship with Russia. Managing European relations with Russia will require significant US involvement, the document says, adding it is a core US interest for hostilities in Ukraine to end. The Trump administration has proposed a plan to end the war, the original version of which called for Ukraine to hand over some territory to the de facto control of Russia. However, Trump's envoy has presented a modified version in Moscow. that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it by force. The White House strategy document repeatedly references the Western Hemisphere, and the need for the US to protect itself from outside threats. The document says there must be a readjustment of ""our global military presence to address urgent threats in our Hemisphere"". To do this, the strategy calls for moving assets away from theatres which are less important to American national security than they once were. This re-prioritising of military power can be seen already in the Caribbean, where the US military has a growing presence and has carried out which the government alleges are carrying drugs. The world's largest warship, the USS Gerald Ford, is currently based in the Caribbean along with its strike group. Away from the western hemisphere, the Trump administration singles out the South China Sea as a key shipping passage that has major implications for the US economy, and the document says the US will ""harden and strengthen our military presence in the Western Pacific"". The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan. It says ""deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority"". China views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. The strategy also talks of pushing for a stronger industrial base in the US and less reliance on foreign technologies, which matches some of the moves the Trump administration has taken with its ."
China-US Relations,"China's investment spree in UK gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC told",2025-11-17T05:49:13.911Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmy5d7k84o,"China has financed tens of billions of pounds' worth of investment in UK businesses and projects this century, some of which gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC Panorama has learned. The spending spree - worth £45bn ($59bn) at 2023 prices - was at its height following a 2015 Chinese state directive, aimed at making the country a global leader in high-tech industries. The UK has been the top destination among G7 nations for these investments, relative to the size of its population and economy, according to US-based research group AidData. Panorama has investigated how this led to cutting-edge technology and skills being transferred to China. The UK was ""far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries"", according to a former head of GCHQ. The BBC was given exclusive early access to data collected by AidData, a research group at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia. A leading specialist in tracking how governments spend money overseas, AidData receives funding from governments and charitable foundations around the world. Some government-backed Chinese investments were purely commercial but others were in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, according to Dr Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. These objectives were laid out by China's communist leaders in a strategic plan 10 years ago, called ""Made In China 2025"". It set ambitious targets for the country to become the industry leader in 10 high-tech sectors, including aerospace, electric vehicles and robotics. This was a far-sighted strategy, according to Prof Keyu Jin of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology: ""It's the longer-term strategic thinking that China has always had, and I'd argue that many other countries also should have."" With access to AidData's research, the BBC has investigated how the purchase of some UK companies has led to technology with military potential to be transferred to China. Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based firm, was one of the companies Panorama looked at. It specialises in semiconductor design - in other words, designing the tiny electronic circuits inside chips that power devices such as computers and smartphones. In 2017, Imagination had recently lost its most important client, Apple, and had seen its share price fall dramatically. It was snapped up for £550m by a private equity firm, Canyon Bridge, based at that time in the US state of California. The Canyon Bridge fund that bought Imagination had one investor - Yitai Capital, whose largest stakeholder is China Reform. This organisation reports to the State Council, the body responsible for carrying out party policies and laws. Two months before Canyon Bridge bought Imagination in the UK, it had tried to buy a semiconductor company in the US. However, that purchase had been blocked by the US's investment-screening laws. The value of Imagination lay in its intellectual property - the expertise of its engineers, amassed over decades. A potential buyer would be buying into this expertise. What is more, the algorithms behind its technology, although developed for other products, could be put to military use in missiles and drones. In his first interview since leaving Imagination, the company's former CEO, Ron Black, says the UK government vetted the deal, and he was told ""unequivocally"" by Canyon Bridge that China Reform would be a passive investor, only interested in making money. However, in 2019, Mr Black says he was summoned to a meeting in Beijing, where he was asked to work directly for China Reform, and oversee the wholesale transfer of Imagination's technology and expertise to China. ""I think [the China Reform representative] said specifically 'from the heads of the British engineers to the Chinese engineers, then lay off the British engineers and you'll make a lot of money',"" says Mr Black. He refused, but he says that several months later, China Reform tried to install four new directors ""with no understanding of semiconductors"" directly onto the board of Imagination Technologies. ""The only attributes they appeared to have was a relationship with China Reform,"" he adds. Convinced that Imagination's technology had the capacity to be used for military purposes, Mr Black began reaching out to contacts in the UK government. He says he was given a sympathetic hearing, but was told this was a private industry matter, and there was not much anyone could do. Fearful about the possible transfer of military-grade technology, Mr Black resigned. At that point, he says, the UK government started to take an interest, and China Reform halted its attempt to install new directors. Mr Black withdrew his resignation but was fired three days later. He was later found by an employment tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed. After he left the company, Imagination's homegrown technology was transferred to China. According to Imagination, its technology is not used in military products. It told Panorama: ""Imagination has always complied with applicable export and trade compliance laws in respect of its commercial licensing of semiconductor IP technology and related transactions."" Canyon Bridge told Panorama ""the Imagination transaction was sourced and led exclusively by Canyon Bridge and its advisers"". Panorama contacted China Reform, but it has not commented on Mr Black's allegations. The Chinese Embassy says its government ""has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations"" and that these enterprises ""also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation - efforts that have been widely welcomed by many countries"". In 2017, the UK had fewer powers to stop the sale of a company such as Imagination to Chinese owners. Two years earlier, China's leader, Xi Jinping, had been welcomed on a state visit, with David Cameron's Conservative government hailing the start of a ""golden era"" in China-UK relations. ""We thought China was basically a very friendly power and there was lots of money to be made,"" says Sir Jeremy Hunt. In 2015 he was health secretary, and later held other government posts, including chancellor of the exchequer and foreign secretary. ""But under the surface, we were beginning to sense a much more assertive China."" The challenge of how to trade with China, while keeping the UK safe, remains an unresolved issue. ""This is the trillion-dollar question,"" says Sir Jeremy Fleming, a former head of GCHQ. The UK has benefited from a trading relationship with China, and from its investment, over the past couple of decades, he says. On the other hand, he adds, the UK has sometimes forgotten that this investment could be used against its own interests. ""My personal view,"" he says, ""is that we have been far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries in science and technology."" Sir Jeremy contrasts the UK's approach with the control exerted by the Chinese: ""They have been very strategic and careful not to allow Western companies to invest or to get involved in key bits of their industry which are strategically important."" Europe as a whole and some US businesses were naive about China in 2017-18, according to John Bolton, former US national security advisor during the first Trump administration. ""There was a reluctance to think we were slipping back into some kind of Cold War,"" he says. Mr Bolton has on several charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. He maintains his innocence. Some experts argue that Beijing did nothing wrong, and that the UK was just short-sighted. China is effectively a one-party state and some argue its autocratic system succeeds because of its long-term strategic planning. The results, seen from China's perspective, have been ""nothing short of remarkable"", says Prof Keyu Jin. ""One of the key advantages of China's political system is the ability to set multi-decade-long goals,"" she says. ""And you do the planning. You do the investment. You set the strategy. You influence the financing. It's not a five-year thing."" In this century, China has been the world's largest overseas lender, to the tune of £1.6tn ($2.1tn) at 2023 prices, AidData's research has revealed. The high point for Chinese overseas investment was during 2016 and 2017, according to Dr Parks. After this point, he says, many countries started strengthening screening mechanisms on national security grounds. The US, Germany and Italy tightened vetting on foreign investment by 2018. The UK followed suit in 2022. Sir Jeremy Fleming is cautiously optimistic that lessons have been learned. ""We have a much stronger regime in place,"" he says. ""But would I say the process is watertight? Absolutely not."" In 2024, a Labour government was elected, but it faced the same issue as its Conservative predecessor - namely, that the UK needed economic growth and China could help. ""One big problem in Europe, including the UK, is that there's not enough investment and funding,"" says Prof Keyu Jin. ""China is very happy to finance some of these projects. And there are lots of areas where there's no real threat of national security."" Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already been . But some Labour MPs are concerned the government has not published its China audit, which it carried out as part of an election manifesto commitment. ""I was promised by the foreign secretary that it would be published,"" says Dame Emily Thornberry MP, the chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Then we hear that the China audit has happened but we're not going to be told about it, we're only going to get a few lines."" The Foreign Office has told Panorama it did not publish its full audit because of its security classification. It says it takes ""a consistent and strategic"" approach to China, the UK's third largest trading partner, it is committed to supporting UK businesses to ""trade securely"", and it will use its powers to protect UK interests."
China-US Relations,Will Starbucks staff strikes hit turnaround plans?,2025-11-12T15:59:31.538Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype4j07xpo,"Starbucks has been working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes. But though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround. Picket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday, as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing. The walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago. Baristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload. ""Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,"" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US. ""You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,"" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May. Starbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the ""vast majority"" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US. During previous coordinated strikes, fewer than 1% of stores participated, the company said, adding that it expected the same turnout this time. But the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment. In recent years the brand has faced consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks. The arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%. He quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal. At the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training. Progress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat. ""We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,"" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts. But the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester. Starbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September. Even after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice. A union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April. The company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would ""significantly affect store operations and customer experience"", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week. ""When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,"" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement. ""Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,"" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30. Unionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months. This continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts. The brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers. ""Happy customers have to come from happy employees,"" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. ""You can't do that top down."" This week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of ""union-busting"" and urging the company to bargain in good faith. Joe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the ""Experience Economy"", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was ""surprised"" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved. ""This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,"" he said."
China-US Relations,Gang jailed for stealing £700k from cash machines,2025-11-26T06:12:13.093Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0pr5q7kg4o,"Six members of a criminal network that stole £700,000 from cash machines across the country have been jailed. Between February and December 2024 the gang, which was based in Romania but operated out of Luton, used sophisticated devices to bypass security systems at cashpoints, investigators said. Late night raids at 51 locations across the UK were carried out to fraudulently withdraw cash in 3,300 separate transactions. Det Insp Dan Barker, from the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), said there was ""no doubt that this group thought they were above the law both here in the UK and in Romania"". After reports were received about fraudulent activity, an investigation was launched by ERSOU which led to detectives uncovering and dismantling the network. An initial five arrests were made in December 2024, with suspects arrested at Luton Airport as they tried to leave the country - and others detained during raids in Luton and Norfolk. Chipboards programmed to bypass cashpoint security measures were seized, along with a cash machine which had been purchased from China. There were indications that new technology was being developed for future offending, ERSOU said. In July, 18 addresses across the Bacau region in Romania were raided with the help of the police in the country and international agencies Europol and Eurojust. Two further arrests were made, with officers seizing a Lamborghini and a Porsche and raiding a stronghold-style property, where the gang's ""FTP"" moniker had been carved into a front gate and printed onto the floor of an outdoor swimming pool. Those arrested were extradited to the UK. Constantin Boghiu, 25, of Kimpton Road, Luton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Alex Militaru, 25, of High Street Watton, Thetford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to two years and five months' imprisonment. Marius Chifan 33, of St Catherines Avenue Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Gabriel Rosu, 33, of Flowers way Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced three and a half years' imprisonment. Razvan Verde, 31, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to launder money, possession of articles for use in fraud and was sentenced to four years and four months' imprisonment. Cristian Cimpoesu, 28, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to a year and a half in prison. All six men were jailed at Luton Crown Court, but in total nine men were convicted in relation to the fraud. Three other members of the group are due to be sentenced at hearings in December and January, with all facing the prospect of deportation after their sentences. Det Insp Barker added: ""This has been a long running operation involving teams from across Europe, and it's positive that these offenders will now be spending spells behind bars."""
China-US Relations,Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry,2025-11-11T00:01:10.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43kyn9d6po,"In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law that saw it take effective control of a Chinese-owned chip company with operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited ""serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia"" that ""posed a threat"". The move allows the Dutch government to ""block decisions if they are harmful or potentially harmful to the company's production"" or to ""the future of Nexperia as a Dutch and European company, and the preservation of this crucial player in Europe's value chain,"" the statement said. The ministry has told the BBC the measure, which is effective for up to a year, does not amount to a takeover of the firm and that the government has no legal control over Nexperia as a result of the action. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want The Hague to revoke its action over Nexperia. ""China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,"" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment. At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called ""legacy"" or ""building block"" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. ""Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,"" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds. Beijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message. ""The narrative was [that, since] Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,"" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China. That didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement. Wingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government. It was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list. According to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's action over Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company earlier in the year. The documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the ""Chinese owner is problematic"". ""It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,"" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents. The Hague denies its actions were a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China. Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this. ""I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,"" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China. ""Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips."" Experts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China. ""This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,"" said Mr Nunlist. European vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time. It is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips. But supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said. ""Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things."" The incident comes as US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year trade truce - a deal which suspended some export bans and rare earth restrictions. But the Nexperia dispute suggests that this newly-minted agreement may be a fragile one. The US is not going to blow up the deal though, according to Mr Nunlist, and Europe doesn't have much leverage especially in this game of supply chain weaponisation. ""This is really politically tricky for both sides, and for Europe because it doesn't want this to end with chip capacity leaving Europe,"" Mr Nunlist said. ""My understanding is that leaders in Brussels were unaware that the Dutch government was planning to make this move and were unhappy with it."" China and the EU remain locked in urgent negotiations to lift export controls on both chips and rare earths. Talks are continuing with China on finding a ""lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows"", EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X over the weekend. But the episode has exposed vulnerabilities in key supply chains - and ties between China and the Netherlands, and in turn the European Union, are likely to remain under pressure until the discord over Nexperia's ownership and operations is fully resolved."
China-US Relations,Suspected Hezbollah member goes on trial in Germany,2025-11-18T19:00:18.163Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg72r6myz4o,"A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU. The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations. In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a ""foreign operator"" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany. According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running ""an extensive drone programme for some time"". Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had ""systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel"". ""By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units."" To procure such drones ""the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon"", prosecutors said. Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024. The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US. According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers. Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies. Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight. Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added. One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur. Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured. The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder. The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October. Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities."
China-US Relations,The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means,2025-11-16T13:33:18.710Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620qppzlgwo,"South Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States. The US has approved the ""attack submarines"" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday. The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west. Here's what you need to know about the agreement. The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding. In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had ""given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel"". In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha. Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India. South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster. ""I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme. President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose. In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a ""proud achievement"" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North. The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""awake at night"", he added. North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials. In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years. North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme. Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race. ""North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,"" she told the BBC. ""[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension."" It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat. ""South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,"" Dr Yang said. ""What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines."" Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal. Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a ""major change"" which ""means South Korea is now a regional player"". ""The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,"" she said. ""It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries."" For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China. ""Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,"" Dr Yang explained. ""South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea."" US and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea. Beijing must be ""furious"" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said. Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would ""deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides"". Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that ""the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive"". Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline. South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did ""not have the capability"" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use."
China-US Relations,"US to sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, Trump says ahead of crown prince's visit",2025-11-18T12:50:24.407Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7512rkvg7ro,"The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,"" Trump said. ""They've been a great ally."" The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago. A US intelligence assessment Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince any role in the murder. Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul. While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a ""pariah"" over its human rights record, Biden in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting. Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the ""largest defence sales agreement in history"", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms. Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers. Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s. One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin. During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects."
China-US Relations,Starmer says China policy cannot continue to blow 'hot and cold',2025-12-01T21:21:40.106Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w7xenlnp1o,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says UK government policy towards China cannot continue to blow ""hot and cold"". Speaking at the annual Lady Mayor's banquet, traditionally used to set out foreign policy for the year ahead, Sir Keir told guests his government will focus on the relationship with China. The speech follows an targeting MPs and parliamentary staff, and comes less than a fortnight before a decision on whether in the capital despite security concerns. The prime minister stressed that being tough on national security will enable the UK to pursue economic opportunities with the world's second biggest economy. Sir Keir's speech in the City of London rejected the ""isolationism"" put forward by opponents of the Chinese government, notably former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who say the state should be treated as an enemy. However, failing to navigate a relationship with China would be ""a dereliction of duty"", the prime minister said, when China is a ""defining force in technology, trade and global governance"". Building a careful relationship would instead bolster the UK's place as a leader on the international stage and help secure UK national interests, he said, while still recognising the ""reality"" that China ""poses national security threats"". ""Instead, for years we have blown hot and cold,"" he said. ""We had the golden age, which then flipped to an Ice Age. We reject that binary choice. ""So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism."" Those security threats were clearly outlined earlier this month, when security services took the unusual step of issuing a warning that specifically identified . The alert explained the profiles were being used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), acting as ""civilian recruitment headhunters"" to target individuals working in British politics ""at scale"", including economists and think tank employees as well as people in Parliament. A Chinese Embassy spokesperson denied the accusations of espionage and said they were ""pure fabrication"" that were ""undermining China-UK relations"". , which would be the biggest in Europe, sitting on a site at Royal Mint Court, which is close to the City of London and fibre optic cables carrying vast quantities of highly sensitive data. Housing Secretary Steve Reed has the final say and is expected to give the green light to the plans, following consultation with MI5 and MI6, in a decision opposed by Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. At the speech in London's Guildhall, Sir Keir insisted there would not be any ""trade-off"" between security and economic access with China, appearing to rule out trade on areas of defence, AI or critical national infrastructure. ""Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty,"" he said. ""But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas."" These areas would include financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals and luxury goods, he said, adding they were: ""Great British success stories –  the export opportunities are huge and we will back you to seize them."" to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

China-US Relations,"Chinese land, US radar and ties to Taiwan: The geopolitics rattling a tiny Pacific nation",2025-11-24T00:19:18.297Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql9lkv5y7zo,"The air above Palau's pristine waters smells of salt and breadfruit, and on calm mornings in Koror, Palau's commercial centre, the whirr of dive boat engines echoes across the bay. A few years ago, those boats were filled with tourists – many from China – drawn to Palau's lagoons and limestone caves. Hotels were full, restaurants bustling, and fishermen could barely keep up with demand. But that is no more. The boom – and the abrupt collapse – was no accident. Between 2015 and 2017, Chinese tourists made up around half of its visitors. Then, in 2017, Beijing reportedly ordered tour operators to stop selling packages to Palau, slashing the main source of tourism to the islands at the time. ""I actually bought new boats to accommodate the sudden increase of tourists,"" said a dive shop owner in Koror. But after the tourism peak, he said, these boats had been ""sitting idle in the bay"" and it took them years just to make back the money they spent. The message was clear, Palauan officials allege. They say that China had used its vast outbound tourism market as part of a broader campaign to try to peel Palau away from recognising Taiwan - and into Beijing's orbit. The BBC reached out to China's foreign ministry for comment but has not received a response. China has, however, in the past repeatedly denied using tourism as political leverage. Palau is one of only a dozen nations that still recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state. This challenges a key pillar of China's foreign policy, the ""one China principle"", in which Beijing asserts sovereignty over Taiwan. But it's not just about a diplomatic tug of war. Palau's location makes it a desirable target for influence from the world's biggest powers. It sits on the so-called ""Second Island Chain"" – a string of outposts the US sees as crucial to containing China's military expansion and responding to any aggression in the western Pacific. Palau and the US have a long history of partnership: before its independence in 1994, Palau was a US-administered territory. Under an agreement known as the Compact of Free Association, Palau gives the US exclusive military access in exchange for Washington's extensive aid, including Palauan citizens' ability to live and work freely in the US. Working under the terms of the Compact, the US is now strengthening its own military footprint in the archipelago. This geopolitical power struggle between China, Taiwan, and the US is cascading down into the daily lives of this tiny nation of fewer than 20,000 people. ""No matter what we do, Palau is going to be the centre of any military activity because of our location,"" Palau's President, Surangel Whipps Jr. told the BBC. Palau's relationship with Taiwan runs deep. When Palau became independent in 1994, Taiwan moved fast to secure a diplomatic ally, according to Cheng-Cheng Li, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Hualien, Taiwan, who has conducted extensive research on Taiwan-Palau relations. Taiwan's assistance to it has been hands-on: agricultural experts working side by side with locals, medical teams in small clinics, funding for local entrepreneurs, and inviting students to Taiwan on scholarships. For a country with a small population where community-based service plays a central role, Taiwan has been described as a ""reliable partner"" and a ""trusted friend"" by many Palauan officials. Taiwan's ambassador to Palau, Jessica Lee, told the BBC that local leaders had assured her that the relationship was ""solid as a rock until death do us part."" Still, Taiwan has reason to worry. In recent years, China has peeled away several of its former allies. In the Pacific region alone, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Nauru have severed their diplomatic ties with it and switched to Beijing since 2019. Beijing sees the democratically governed island of Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. Controlling Taiwan is essential to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's goal of reversing what he called China's ""century of humiliation"" by colonial powers, according to analysts. ""Both the US and Taiwan are paranoid and jumpy about Palau switching,"" said Graeme Smith, a senior fellow at the Australian National University. ""They'll put a lot of resources into making sure it doesn't happen."" Officials in both Palau and Taiwan say Beijing has pulled on a range of levers to influence Palau's diplomatic position. After he took office in 2021, Palau's president publicly claimed that China offered ""a million"" tourists in exchange for Palau to this end. He refused. Then in 2024, China's foreign ministry issued a safety alert, advising Chinese nationals to ""exercise caution"" when travelling to Palau. ""If China uses tourism as a weapon, then it's an unstable market that we shouldn't depend on,"" President Whipps Jr. told the BBC. ""If China wants a relationship with Palau, they can, but they cannot tell us we cannot have a relationship with Taiwan."" China, however, denies using tourism as a political tool. In an opinion published last year in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist party, the paper stated that China's intention when issuing the alert was to protect its overseas citizens in light of the ""increasing public security cases in Palau"". It added that the accusations from the president were an attempt to smear China and interfere in its domestic affairs. When asked in 2017 about the banning of tour groups, China's foreign ministry spokesperson said that he ""had not heard about the situation"". But in 2024, responding to Palau's continued recognition of Taiwan, the ministry urged Palau to ""make the correct decisions that conform to their own... interests"". Whilst China has not commented on the alleged offer of a million tourists, not everyone agrees with President Whipps Jr.'s assessment. Many locals who spoke with the BBC don't share the president's view on tourism. ""He's very hawkish towards China,"" said Pai Lee, the Taiwanese owner of a hotel in Koror. ""I don't think it's correct to say that China 'weaponised' tourism – they are simply using this as a bargaining chip, just like how people play chess and countries do it all the time."" In any case, the legacy of the sudden tourism swing remains visible. The economic shock after the suspension of tour groups  was sharp, but so was the environmental toll of the sudden influx of tourists itself. Palau, according to environmental protection organisations, was not ready for mass tourism. ""After the end of the explosion of Chinese tourism, I went there and the corals were dead,"" said Ann Singeo, director of the Ebiil Society, a local NGO. ""You'd see [hundreds of] people in this little cove, all standing on corals. That was the price we paid because we didn't have rules in place to use these resources respectfully."" Tourism is just one part of China's alleged playbook. Beijing has also been trying to strengthen relationships with local leaders: Palauan officials say they have repeatedly been invited to Beijing for visits. On one such visit, a former Palauan governor said he asked why Taiwan couldn't become independent. ""Taiwan is part of China"", replied a Chinese Communist Party official, looking furious. With China's intensifying military activities around Taiwan, including air and sea patrols, the US has claimed that China is readying its military to be capable of invading it. To contain China's potential aggression towards Taiwan and overall military activities in the western Pacific, the US has ramped up its own military infrastructure buildup in Palau. Over the years, Washington has been upgrading airstrips, building Tactical Multi-Mission Over-the-horizon Radar system (Tacmor) used to monitor military activities in the Pacific, and planning on expanding Malakal Harbour, Palau's main port, to accommodate larger military vessels. However, the US has expressed concern over a particular vulnerability: land acquisition. Documents seen by the BBC show that several Chinese businesses have leased land and developed properties close to these sites, from undeveloped land to hotels overlooking the harbour and Palau's main airport. In Angaur, a southern state of Palau, for example, the US is now building the receiver site of Tacmor – the plan was announced in 2017. However, in 2019 and 2020, Chinese investors leased land covering over 350,000 square metres following the announcement of radar construction. One investor, Zhuang Cizhong, proposed building a resort there. ""We went to visit his company in China, and he laid out a plan for a retirement home for rich Chinese,"" said the former governor of Angaur, Marvin Ngirutang, who believes Palau's government should work more closely with China. ""There were booklets of blueprints – it looked legitimate."" The project was never built. Zhuang blamed Covid-19, but Washington remains wary. The US ambassador in Palau could not be reached for comment, but he has previously voiced his concerns. ""All around there are various plots of land now leased to Chinese interests,"" US ambassador Joel Ehrendreich told Reuters. ""I don't think it's any coincidence that it happens to be physically close to our projects."" Such worries are shared locally. ""The concern is that these investments or leases are not legitimate businesses,"" said Jennifer Anson, Palau's national security advisor. ""Maybe on the outside, but when the time comes that China invades Taiwan, these could be transformed into military sites."" Chinese media reports, however, suggest that there were legitimate reasons to push for businesses to invest in Palau. In 2019, Phoenix News, a state-affiliated broadcaster, extolled the virtues of buying property in Palau, citing abundant tourism resources and relaxed legislation. The BBC is unable to contact Zhuang. China's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on matters related to land leases. Chinese-linked organised crime has also proliferated since 2018, according to authorities in Palau. President Whipps Jr. said that there was a ""constant battle going on"" as he pointed to crimes linked to China, including scamming, illegal casinos, and cyberattacks. Some officials claim criminals have exploited the lack of diplomatic ties between China and Palau. Wan Kuok Koi, known as ""Broken Tooth,"" who led the infamous Macau-based 14k triad, for example, entered Palau as a foreign investor in 2018. The crime syndicate later engaged in bribery, corruption and online gambling in countries including Palau. Additionally, in 2025, the US Treasury sanctioned several individuals in Palau for their links to the Prince Group, a Chinese-run conglomerate. The group has been accused of scamming, money laundering, industrial-scale human trafficking, among other crimes. Prince Group did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but has previously ""categorically"" denied having engaged in ""any unlawful activity,"" according to the company's statement following the US sanction. Many of these individuals have been placed on Palau's own ""undesirable alien list"", and according to Ms. Anson from Palau's national security office, they are banking on China's inability to hunt them down because of the lack of diplomatic relations. ""When you trawl Chinese diaspora sites in Cambodia, where the wisdom of relocating to Palau is sometimes debated, the criminals themselves are drawn by the lack of PRC diplomatic presence there,"" said ANU's Graeme Smith. For many Palauans, talk of high-level geopolitical struggle feels distant, yet its ripples are everywhere. The US military expansion, Chinese investment, and rumours of hidden agendas feed a growing sense of unease. ""This administration is very hawkish towards China, and I think it's ridiculous,"" said the former governor of Angaur, who opposes the construction of Tacmor. ""We should concentrate on the environment and less on China-US relations"". A petition circulating in recent months asks Washington to spell out its contingency plans in the event of war – a sign of how deep the anxiety runs. It calls on the US to ""reassure the people of Palau"" that civilians will be protected if conflict was o break out. ""We know what the geopolitics looks like between China and the US,"" said one resident. ""And we are scared our island will be destroyed by a war we don't want to be part of""."
China-US Relations,"Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in Delhi",2025-12-04T14:56:51.122Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q2vpggr9o,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries. Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil. It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war. India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet. Why are relations with India key for the Kremlin? Well, for a start, look at the numbers: That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil. India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian. That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market. India was happy. Washington less so. Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying. For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers. But there's geopolitics at play, too. The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed. Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that. So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a ""multi-polar world"". Russia lauds its ""no limits partnership"" with China. It is just as vocal about its ""special and privileged strategic partnership"" with India. That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union. ""I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,"" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov. ""We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy. ""But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India."" This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi. Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions. India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape. Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him. As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict. This was India's ""strategic autonomy"" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time. That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here. Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his ""true friend"". But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine. And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe. ""For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,"" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank. Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia. Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades. Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct. With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade. Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing. But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets. India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix. Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible. But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin. Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance. ""Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,"" GTRI said. Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy. He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West. ""Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,"" GTRI said."
China-US Relations,Thai king becomes country's first monarch to visit China,2025-11-13T09:09:02.801Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l750p7y5no,"King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand has arrived in China on Thursday, the first ever visit by a reigning Thai monarch. The visit is at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping to celebrate the 50th anniversary of both countries establishing diplomatic ties for the first time in 1975. China is believed to have been pushing for this visit for some years. The Thai government said in a statement that the trip ""underlines the deep-rooted friendship and mutual understanding shared between Thailand and China at all levels"". In Beijing, the king and his wife Queen Suthida will visit local landmarks like the Lingguang Buddhist Temple and the Beijing Aerospace City. President Xi and his wife will also host a state banquet for the Thai royals. This is the first major state visit by King Vajiralongkorn since he came to the throne nine years ago – in April he also made a trip to Bhutan. By contrast the most high-profile overseas trips made by his father King Bhumibol were to the United States in the 1960s, when Thailand was feted as a crucial Cold War partner, and a vital base for US military operations in Indochina. Thailand is still officially a military ally of the US, but relations with China have grown steadily closer in recent years, while those with Washington have been frayed by US criticism of human rights in Thailand, by President Trump's tariffs, and a perception that the US is no longer as committed as it once was to its Asian friends. China is Thailand's biggest trading partner, and increasingly a rival to the US as a source of military equipment. Many Thais can trace their ancestry to migrants who came from China, and the Chinese government often highlights what it calls their ""brotherly"" or ""family"" relations. The importance of those ties to Thailand was underlined earlier this year when the Thai authorities deported 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers back to China, in defiance of a warning not to do so by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Then in August an exhibition at Bangkok's main arts centre featuring Uyghur and Tibetan artists was censored following complaints by Chinese diplomats. The Thai government was spurred by Chinese pressure into taking action against scam compounds operating along its border with Myanmar, and objections by China are presumed to have been one of the factors which blocked a proposal to legalise casinos in Thailand. Despite the lack of a Thai royal visit before this one, the Thai monarchy has played a significant role in sustaining Thai-Chinese relations through the work of the king's younger sister, Princess Sirindhorn, who has studied Chinese art and language for the past 45 years, and been a frequent visitor to China."
China-US Relations,Trump administration says Europe faces 'civilisational erasure',2025-12-05T12:07:34.641Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04vdengk3do,"US President Donald Trump's administration has warned that Europe faces ""civilisational erasure"" and questioned whether certain nations can remain reliable allies, in a new strategy document that puts a particular focus on the continent. The 33-page National Security Strategy sees the US leader outline his vision for the world and how he will wield US military and economic power to work towards it. Trump described the document as a ""roadmap"" to ensure the US remains ""the greatest and most successful nation in human history"". European politicians have begun to react, with Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying his country did not need ""outside advice"". A formal National Security Strategy is typically released by presidents once per term. It can form a framework for future policies and budgets, as well as signalling to the world where the president's priorities lie. The new document follows similar rhetoric to earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy. The new report doubles down on Trump's point of view, calling for the restoration of ""Western identity"", combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and focusing more on US priorities such as stopping drug cartels. Focusing on Europe, it asserts that if current trends continue the continent would be ""unrecognisable in 20 years or less"" and its economic issues are ""eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure"". ""It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,"" the document states. It also accused the EU and ""other transnational bodies"" of carrying out activities that ""undermine political liberty and sovereignty"". It said migration policies were ""creating strife"" and that other issues included ""censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence"". Conversely, the document hails the growing influence of ""patriotic European parties"" and says ""America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit"". The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been . Germany's Wadephul stressed that the ""United States is and will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance"", but said ""this alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues"". ""I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany,"" he added. Referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the document says Europe has a lack of ""self-confidence"" in its relationship with Russia. Managing European relations with Russia will require significant US involvement, the document says, adding it is a core US interest for hostilities in Ukraine to end. The Trump administration has proposed a plan to end the war, the original version of which called for Ukraine to hand over some territory to the de facto control of Russia. However, Trump's envoy has presented a modified version in Moscow. that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it by force. The White House strategy document repeatedly references the Western Hemisphere, and the need for the US to protect itself from outside threats. The document says there must be a readjustment of ""our global military presence to address urgent threats in our Hemisphere"". To do this, the strategy calls for moving assets away from theatres which are less important to American national security than they once were. This re-prioritising of military power can be seen already in the Caribbean, where the US military has a growing presence and has carried out which the government alleges are carrying drugs. The world's largest warship, the USS Gerald Ford, is currently based in the Caribbean along with its strike group. Away from the western hemisphere, the Trump administration singles out the South China Sea as a key shipping passage that has major implications for the US economy, and the document says the US will ""harden and strengthen our military presence in the Western Pacific"". The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan. It says ""deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority"". China views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. The strategy also talks of pushing for a stronger industrial base in the US and less reliance on foreign technologies, which matches some of the moves the Trump administration has taken with its ."
China-US Relations,A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree,2025-11-17T23:01:18.831Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o,"Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications. But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. ""Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'"" he remembers. ""I was astonished!"" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret. But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: ""There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence."" The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA. Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale. Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment. High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018. Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent. ""For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,"" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. ""And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses."" AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China. A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the . The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access. AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries. ""China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,"" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities. ""The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,"" Mr Shih says. ""This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis."" Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025. In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China. Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it ""stayed very much alive"" as a guiding strategy. ""There are all kinds of plans still being published,"" he says, ""including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan."" At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating ""high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement"" until 2030. AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how . The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA. AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy. ""At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,"" he says. ""I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen."" However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts. ""The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,"" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC. ""Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation."" China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment. In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company. It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech. Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company. That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing. Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets. Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past. ""We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,"" she says. ""Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this."" Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China. ""There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,"" she says. ""Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe."" If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over? ""No! There's gonna be multiple laps,"" maintains Brad Parks. ""There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital. ""So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. ""They're going to move from defence to offence."""
China-US Relations,"China's investment spree in UK gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC told",2025-11-17T05:49:13.911Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmy5d7k84o,"China has financed tens of billions of pounds' worth of investment in UK businesses and projects this century, some of which gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC Panorama has learned. The spending spree - worth £45bn ($59bn) at 2023 prices - was at its height following a 2015 Chinese state directive, aimed at making the country a global leader in high-tech industries. The UK has been the top destination among G7 nations for these investments, relative to the size of its population and economy, according to US-based research group AidData. Panorama has investigated how this led to cutting-edge technology and skills being transferred to China. The UK was ""far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries"", according to a former head of GCHQ. The BBC was given exclusive early access to data collected by AidData, a research group at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia. A leading specialist in tracking how governments spend money overseas, AidData receives funding from governments and charitable foundations around the world. Some government-backed Chinese investments were purely commercial but others were in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, according to Dr Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. These objectives were laid out by China's communist leaders in a strategic plan 10 years ago, called ""Made In China 2025"". It set ambitious targets for the country to become the industry leader in 10 high-tech sectors, including aerospace, electric vehicles and robotics. This was a far-sighted strategy, according to Prof Keyu Jin of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology: ""It's the longer-term strategic thinking that China has always had, and I'd argue that many other countries also should have."" With access to AidData's research, the BBC has investigated how the purchase of some UK companies has led to technology with military potential to be transferred to China. Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based firm, was one of the companies Panorama looked at. It specialises in semiconductor design - in other words, designing the tiny electronic circuits inside chips that power devices such as computers and smartphones. In 2017, Imagination had recently lost its most important client, Apple, and had seen its share price fall dramatically. It was snapped up for £550m by a private equity firm, Canyon Bridge, based at that time in the US state of California. The Canyon Bridge fund that bought Imagination had one investor - Yitai Capital, whose largest stakeholder is China Reform. This organisation reports to the State Council, the body responsible for carrying out party policies and laws. Two months before Canyon Bridge bought Imagination in the UK, it had tried to buy a semiconductor company in the US. However, that purchase had been blocked by the US's investment-screening laws. The value of Imagination lay in its intellectual property - the expertise of its engineers, amassed over decades. A potential buyer would be buying into this expertise. What is more, the algorithms behind its technology, although developed for other products, could be put to military use in missiles and drones. In his first interview since leaving Imagination, the company's former CEO, Ron Black, says the UK government vetted the deal, and he was told ""unequivocally"" by Canyon Bridge that China Reform would be a passive investor, only interested in making money. However, in 2019, Mr Black says he was summoned to a meeting in Beijing, where he was asked to work directly for China Reform, and oversee the wholesale transfer of Imagination's technology and expertise to China. ""I think [the China Reform representative] said specifically 'from the heads of the British engineers to the Chinese engineers, then lay off the British engineers and you'll make a lot of money',"" says Mr Black. He refused, but he says that several months later, China Reform tried to install four new directors ""with no understanding of semiconductors"" directly onto the board of Imagination Technologies. ""The only attributes they appeared to have was a relationship with China Reform,"" he adds. Convinced that Imagination's technology had the capacity to be used for military purposes, Mr Black began reaching out to contacts in the UK government. He says he was given a sympathetic hearing, but was told this was a private industry matter, and there was not much anyone could do. Fearful about the possible transfer of military-grade technology, Mr Black resigned. At that point, he says, the UK government started to take an interest, and China Reform halted its attempt to install new directors. Mr Black withdrew his resignation but was fired three days later. He was later found by an employment tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed. After he left the company, Imagination's homegrown technology was transferred to China. According to Imagination, its technology is not used in military products. It told Panorama: ""Imagination has always complied with applicable export and trade compliance laws in respect of its commercial licensing of semiconductor IP technology and related transactions."" Canyon Bridge told Panorama ""the Imagination transaction was sourced and led exclusively by Canyon Bridge and its advisers"". Panorama contacted China Reform, but it has not commented on Mr Black's allegations. The Chinese Embassy says its government ""has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations"" and that these enterprises ""also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation - efforts that have been widely welcomed by many countries"". In 2017, the UK had fewer powers to stop the sale of a company such as Imagination to Chinese owners. Two years earlier, China's leader, Xi Jinping, had been welcomed on a state visit, with David Cameron's Conservative government hailing the start of a ""golden era"" in China-UK relations. ""We thought China was basically a very friendly power and there was lots of money to be made,"" says Sir Jeremy Hunt. In 2015 he was health secretary, and later held other government posts, including chancellor of the exchequer and foreign secretary. ""But under the surface, we were beginning to sense a much more assertive China."" The challenge of how to trade with China, while keeping the UK safe, remains an unresolved issue. ""This is the trillion-dollar question,"" says Sir Jeremy Fleming, a former head of GCHQ. The UK has benefited from a trading relationship with China, and from its investment, over the past couple of decades, he says. On the other hand, he adds, the UK has sometimes forgotten that this investment could be used against its own interests. ""My personal view,"" he says, ""is that we have been far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries in science and technology."" Sir Jeremy contrasts the UK's approach with the control exerted by the Chinese: ""They have been very strategic and careful not to allow Western companies to invest or to get involved in key bits of their industry which are strategically important."" Europe as a whole and some US businesses were naive about China in 2017-18, according to John Bolton, former US national security advisor during the first Trump administration. ""There was a reluctance to think we were slipping back into some kind of Cold War,"" he says. Mr Bolton has on several charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. He maintains his innocence. Some experts argue that Beijing did nothing wrong, and that the UK was just short-sighted. China is effectively a one-party state and some argue its autocratic system succeeds because of its long-term strategic planning. The results, seen from China's perspective, have been ""nothing short of remarkable"", says Prof Keyu Jin. ""One of the key advantages of China's political system is the ability to set multi-decade-long goals,"" she says. ""And you do the planning. You do the investment. You set the strategy. You influence the financing. It's not a five-year thing."" In this century, China has been the world's largest overseas lender, to the tune of £1.6tn ($2.1tn) at 2023 prices, AidData's research has revealed. The high point for Chinese overseas investment was during 2016 and 2017, according to Dr Parks. After this point, he says, many countries started strengthening screening mechanisms on national security grounds. The US, Germany and Italy tightened vetting on foreign investment by 2018. The UK followed suit in 2022. Sir Jeremy Fleming is cautiously optimistic that lessons have been learned. ""We have a much stronger regime in place,"" he says. ""But would I say the process is watertight? Absolutely not."" In 2024, a Labour government was elected, but it faced the same issue as its Conservative predecessor - namely, that the UK needed economic growth and China could help. ""One big problem in Europe, including the UK, is that there's not enough investment and funding,"" says Prof Keyu Jin. ""China is very happy to finance some of these projects. And there are lots of areas where there's no real threat of national security."" Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already been . But some Labour MPs are concerned the government has not published its China audit, which it carried out as part of an election manifesto commitment. ""I was promised by the foreign secretary that it would be published,"" says Dame Emily Thornberry MP, the chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Then we hear that the China audit has happened but we're not going to be told about it, we're only going to get a few lines."" The Foreign Office has told Panorama it did not publish its full audit because of its security classification. It says it takes ""a consistent and strategic"" approach to China, the UK's third largest trading partner, it is committed to supporting UK businesses to ""trade securely"", and it will use its powers to protect UK interests."
China-US Relations,Will Starbucks staff strikes hit turnaround plans?,2025-11-12T15:59:31.538Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype4j07xpo,"Starbucks has been working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes. But though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround. Picket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday, as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing. The walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago. Baristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload. ""Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,"" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US. ""You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,"" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May. Starbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the ""vast majority"" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US. During previous coordinated strikes, fewer than 1% of stores participated, the company said, adding that it expected the same turnout this time. But the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment. In recent years the brand has faced consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks. The arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%. He quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal. At the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training. Progress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat. ""We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,"" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts. But the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester. Starbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September. Even after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice. A union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April. The company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would ""significantly affect store operations and customer experience"", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week. ""When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,"" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement. ""Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,"" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30. Unionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months. This continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts. The brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers. ""Happy customers have to come from happy employees,"" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. ""You can't do that top down."" This week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of ""union-busting"" and urging the company to bargain in good faith. Joe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the ""Experience Economy"", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was ""surprised"" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved. ""This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,"" he said."
China-US Relations,Gang jailed for stealing £700k from cash machines,2025-11-26T06:12:13.093Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0pr5q7kg4o,"Six members of a criminal network that stole £700,000 from cash machines across the country have been jailed. Between February and December 2024 the gang, which was based in Romania but operated out of Luton, used sophisticated devices to bypass security systems at cashpoints, investigators said. Late night raids at 51 locations across the UK were carried out to fraudulently withdraw cash in 3,300 separate transactions. Det Insp Dan Barker, from the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), said there was ""no doubt that this group thought they were above the law both here in the UK and in Romania"". After reports were received about fraudulent activity, an investigation was launched by ERSOU which led to detectives uncovering and dismantling the network. An initial five arrests were made in December 2024, with suspects arrested at Luton Airport as they tried to leave the country - and others detained during raids in Luton and Norfolk. Chipboards programmed to bypass cashpoint security measures were seized, along with a cash machine which had been purchased from China. There were indications that new technology was being developed for future offending, ERSOU said. In July, 18 addresses across the Bacau region in Romania were raided with the help of the police in the country and international agencies Europol and Eurojust. Two further arrests were made, with officers seizing a Lamborghini and a Porsche and raiding a stronghold-style property, where the gang's ""FTP"" moniker had been carved into a front gate and printed onto the floor of an outdoor swimming pool. Those arrested were extradited to the UK. Constantin Boghiu, 25, of Kimpton Road, Luton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Alex Militaru, 25, of High Street Watton, Thetford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to two years and five months' imprisonment. Marius Chifan 33, of St Catherines Avenue Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Gabriel Rosu, 33, of Flowers way Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced three and a half years' imprisonment. Razvan Verde, 31, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to launder money, possession of articles for use in fraud and was sentenced to four years and four months' imprisonment. Cristian Cimpoesu, 28, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to a year and a half in prison. All six men were jailed at Luton Crown Court, but in total nine men were convicted in relation to the fraud. Three other members of the group are due to be sentenced at hearings in December and January, with all facing the prospect of deportation after their sentences. Det Insp Barker added: ""This has been a long running operation involving teams from across Europe, and it's positive that these offenders will now be spending spells behind bars."""
China-US Relations,Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry,2025-11-11T00:01:10.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43kyn9d6po,"In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law that saw it take effective control of a Chinese-owned chip company with operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited ""serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia"" that ""posed a threat"". The move allows the Dutch government to ""block decisions if they are harmful or potentially harmful to the company's production"" or to ""the future of Nexperia as a Dutch and European company, and the preservation of this crucial player in Europe's value chain,"" the statement said. The ministry has told the BBC the measure, which is effective for up to a year, does not amount to a takeover of the firm and that the government has no legal control over Nexperia as a result of the action. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want The Hague to revoke its action over Nexperia. ""China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,"" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment. At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called ""legacy"" or ""building block"" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. ""Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,"" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds. Beijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message. ""The narrative was [that, since] Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,"" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China. That didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement. Wingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government. It was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list. According to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's action over Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company earlier in the year. The documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the ""Chinese owner is problematic"". ""It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,"" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents. The Hague denies its actions were a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China. Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this. ""I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,"" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China. ""Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips."" Experts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China. ""This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,"" said Mr Nunlist. European vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time. It is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips. But supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said. ""Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things."" The incident comes as US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year trade truce - a deal which suspended some export bans and rare earth restrictions. But the Nexperia dispute suggests that this newly-minted agreement may be a fragile one. The US is not going to blow up the deal though, according to Mr Nunlist, and Europe doesn't have much leverage especially in this game of supply chain weaponisation. ""This is really politically tricky for both sides, and for Europe because it doesn't want this to end with chip capacity leaving Europe,"" Mr Nunlist said. ""My understanding is that leaders in Brussels were unaware that the Dutch government was planning to make this move and were unhappy with it."" China and the EU remain locked in urgent negotiations to lift export controls on both chips and rare earths. Talks are continuing with China on finding a ""lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows"", EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X over the weekend. But the episode has exposed vulnerabilities in key supply chains - and ties between China and the Netherlands, and in turn the European Union, are likely to remain under pressure until the discord over Nexperia's ownership and operations is fully resolved."
China-US Relations,"US to sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, Trump says ahead of crown prince's visit",2025-11-18T12:50:24.407Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7512rkvg7ro,"The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,"" Trump said. ""They've been a great ally."" The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago. A US intelligence assessment Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince any role in the murder. Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul. While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a ""pariah"" over its human rights record, Biden in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting. Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the ""largest defence sales agreement in history"", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms. Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers. Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s. One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin. During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects."
China-US Relations,The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means,2025-11-16T13:33:18.710Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620qppzlgwo,"South Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States. The US has approved the ""attack submarines"" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday. The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west. Here's what you need to know about the agreement. The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding. In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had ""given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel"". In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha. Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India. South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster. ""I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme. President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose. In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a ""proud achievement"" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North. The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""awake at night"", he added. North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials. In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years. North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme. Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race. ""North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,"" she told the BBC. ""[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension."" It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat. ""South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,"" Dr Yang said. ""What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines."" Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal. Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a ""major change"" which ""means South Korea is now a regional player"". ""The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,"" she said. ""It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries."" For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China. ""Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,"" Dr Yang explained. ""South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea."" US and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea. Beijing must be ""furious"" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said. Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would ""deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides"". Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that ""the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive"". Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline. South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did ""not have the capability"" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use."
China-US Relations,Suspected Hezbollah member goes on trial in Germany,2025-11-18T19:00:18.163Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg72r6myz4o,"A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU. The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations. In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a ""foreign operator"" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany. According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running ""an extensive drone programme for some time"". Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had ""systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel"". ""By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units."" To procure such drones ""the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon"", prosecutors said. Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024. The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US. According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers. Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies. Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight. Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added. One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur. Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured. The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder. The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October. Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities."
China-US Relations,Starmer says China policy cannot continue to blow 'hot and cold',2025-12-01T21:21:40.106Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w7xenlnp1o,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says UK government policy towards China cannot continue to blow ""hot and cold"". Speaking at the annual Lady Mayor's banquet, traditionally used to set out foreign policy for the year ahead, Sir Keir told guests his government will focus on the relationship with China. The speech follows an targeting MPs and parliamentary staff, and comes less than a fortnight before a decision on whether in the capital despite security concerns. The prime minister stressed that being tough on national security will enable the UK to pursue economic opportunities with the world's second biggest economy. Sir Keir's speech in the City of London rejected the ""isolationism"" put forward by opponents of the Chinese government, notably former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who say the state should be treated as an enemy. However, failing to navigate a relationship with China would be ""a dereliction of duty"", the prime minister said, when China is a ""defining force in technology, trade and global governance"". Building a careful relationship would instead bolster the UK's place as a leader on the international stage and help secure UK national interests, he said, while still recognising the ""reality"" that China ""poses national security threats"". ""Instead, for years we have blown hot and cold,"" he said. ""We had the golden age, which then flipped to an Ice Age. We reject that binary choice. ""So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism."" Those security threats were clearly outlined earlier this month, when security services took the unusual step of issuing a warning that specifically identified . The alert explained the profiles were being used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), acting as ""civilian recruitment headhunters"" to target individuals working in British politics ""at scale"", including economists and think tank employees as well as people in Parliament. A Chinese Embassy spokesperson denied the accusations of espionage and said they were ""pure fabrication"" that were ""undermining China-UK relations"". , which would be the biggest in Europe, sitting on a site at Royal Mint Court, which is close to the City of London and fibre optic cables carrying vast quantities of highly sensitive data. Housing Secretary Steve Reed has the final say and is expected to give the green light to the plans, following consultation with MI5 and MI6, in a decision opposed by Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. At the speech in London's Guildhall, Sir Keir insisted there would not be any ""trade-off"" between security and economic access with China, appearing to rule out trade on areas of defence, AI or critical national infrastructure. ""Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty,"" he said. ""But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas."" These areas would include financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals and luxury goods, he said, adding they were: ""Great British success stories –  the export opportunities are huge and we will back you to seize them."" to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

China-US Relations,"Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in Delhi",2025-12-04T14:56:51.122Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q2vpggr9o,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries. Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil. It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war. India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet. Why are relations with India key for the Kremlin? Well, for a start, look at the numbers: That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil. India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian. That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market. India was happy. Washington less so. Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying. For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers. But there's geopolitics at play, too. The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed. Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that. So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a ""multi-polar world"". Russia lauds its ""no limits partnership"" with China. It is just as vocal about its ""special and privileged strategic partnership"" with India. That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union. ""I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,"" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov. ""We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy. ""But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India."" This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi. Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions. India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape. Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him. As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict. This was India's ""strategic autonomy"" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time. That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here. Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his ""true friend"". But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine. And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe. ""For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,"" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank. Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia. Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades. Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct. With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade. Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing. But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets. India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix. Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible. But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin. Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance. ""Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,"" GTRI said. Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy. He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West. ""Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,"" GTRI said."
China-US Relations,Thai king becomes country's first monarch to visit China,2025-11-13T09:09:02.801Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l750p7y5no,"King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand has arrived in China on Thursday, the first ever visit by a reigning Thai monarch. The visit is at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping to celebrate the 50th anniversary of both countries establishing diplomatic ties for the first time in 1975. China is believed to have been pushing for this visit for some years. The Thai government said in a statement that the trip ""underlines the deep-rooted friendship and mutual understanding shared between Thailand and China at all levels"". In Beijing, the king and his wife Queen Suthida will visit local landmarks like the Lingguang Buddhist Temple and the Beijing Aerospace City. President Xi and his wife will also host a state banquet for the Thai royals. This is the first major state visit by King Vajiralongkorn since he came to the throne nine years ago – in April he also made a trip to Bhutan. By contrast the most high-profile overseas trips made by his father King Bhumibol were to the United States in the 1960s, when Thailand was feted as a crucial Cold War partner, and a vital base for US military operations in Indochina. Thailand is still officially a military ally of the US, but relations with China have grown steadily closer in recent years, while those with Washington have been frayed by US criticism of human rights in Thailand, by President Trump's tariffs, and a perception that the US is no longer as committed as it once was to its Asian friends. China is Thailand's biggest trading partner, and increasingly a rival to the US as a source of military equipment. Many Thais can trace their ancestry to migrants who came from China, and the Chinese government often highlights what it calls their ""brotherly"" or ""family"" relations. The importance of those ties to Thailand was underlined earlier this year when the Thai authorities deported 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers back to China, in defiance of a warning not to do so by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Then in August an exhibition at Bangkok's main arts centre featuring Uyghur and Tibetan artists was censored following complaints by Chinese diplomats. The Thai government was spurred by Chinese pressure into taking action against scam compounds operating along its border with Myanmar, and objections by China are presumed to have been one of the factors which blocked a proposal to legalise casinos in Thailand. Despite the lack of a Thai royal visit before this one, the Thai monarchy has played a significant role in sustaining Thai-Chinese relations through the work of the king's younger sister, Princess Sirindhorn, who has studied Chinese art and language for the past 45 years, and been a frequent visitor to China."
China-US Relations,Trump administration says Europe faces 'civilisational erasure',2025-12-05T12:07:34.641Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04vdengk3do,"US President Donald Trump's administration has warned that Europe faces ""civilisational erasure"" and questioned whether certain nations can remain reliable allies, in a new strategy document that puts a particular focus on the continent. The 33-page National Security Strategy sees the US leader outline his vision for the world and how he will wield US military and economic power to work towards it. Trump described the document as a ""roadmap"" to ensure the US remains ""the greatest and most successful nation in human history"". European politicians have begun to react, with Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying his country did not need ""outside advice"". A formal National Security Strategy is typically released by presidents once per term. It can form a framework for future policies and budgets, as well as signalling to the world where the president's priorities lie. The new document follows similar rhetoric to earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy. The new report doubles down on Trump's point of view, calling for the restoration of ""Western identity"", combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and focusing more on US priorities such as stopping drug cartels. Focusing on Europe, it asserts that if current trends continue the continent would be ""unrecognisable in 20 years or less"" and its economic issues are ""eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure"". ""It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,"" the document states. It also accused the EU and ""other transnational bodies"" of carrying out activities that ""undermine political liberty and sovereignty"". It said migration policies were ""creating strife"" and that other issues included ""censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence"". Conversely, the document hails the growing influence of ""patriotic European parties"" and says ""America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit"". The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been . Germany's Wadephul stressed that the ""United States is and will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance"", but said ""this alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues"". ""I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany,"" he added. Referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the document says Europe has a lack of ""self-confidence"" in its relationship with Russia. Managing European relations with Russia will require significant US involvement, the document says, adding it is a core US interest for hostilities in Ukraine to end. The Trump administration has proposed a plan to end the war, the original version of which called for Ukraine to hand over some territory to the de facto control of Russia. However, Trump's envoy has presented a modified version in Moscow. that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it by force. The White House strategy document repeatedly references the Western Hemisphere, and the need for the US to protect itself from outside threats. The document says there must be a readjustment of ""our global military presence to address urgent threats in our Hemisphere"". To do this, the strategy calls for moving assets away from theatres which are less important to American national security than they once were. This re-prioritising of military power can be seen already in the Caribbean, where the US military has a growing presence and has carried out which the government alleges are carrying drugs. The world's largest warship, the USS Gerald Ford, is currently based in the Caribbean along with its strike group. Away from the western hemisphere, the Trump administration singles out the South China Sea as a key shipping passage that has major implications for the US economy, and the document says the US will ""harden and strengthen our military presence in the Western Pacific"". The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan. It says ""deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority"". China views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. The strategy also talks of pushing for a stronger industrial base in the US and less reliance on foreign technologies, which matches some of the moves the Trump administration has taken with its ."
China-US Relations,A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree,2025-11-17T23:01:18.831Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o,"Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications. But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. ""Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'"" he remembers. ""I was astonished!"" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret. But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: ""There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence."" The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA. Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale. Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment. High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018. Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent. ""For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,"" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. ""And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses."" AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China. A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the . The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access. AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries. ""China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,"" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities. ""The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,"" Mr Shih says. ""This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis."" Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025. In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China. Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it ""stayed very much alive"" as a guiding strategy. ""There are all kinds of plans still being published,"" he says, ""including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan."" At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating ""high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement"" until 2030. AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how . The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA. AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy. ""At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,"" he says. ""I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen."" However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts. ""The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,"" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC. ""Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation."" China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment. In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company. It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech. Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company. That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing. Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets. Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past. ""We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,"" she says. ""Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this."" Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China. ""There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,"" she says. ""Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe."" If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over? ""No! There's gonna be multiple laps,"" maintains Brad Parks. ""There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital. ""So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. ""They're going to move from defence to offence."""
China-US Relations,"China's investment spree in UK gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC told",2025-11-17T05:49:13.911Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmy5d7k84o,"China has financed tens of billions of pounds' worth of investment in UK businesses and projects this century, some of which gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC Panorama has learned. The spending spree - worth £45bn ($59bn) at 2023 prices - was at its height following a 2015 Chinese state directive, aimed at making the country a global leader in high-tech industries. The UK has been the top destination among G7 nations for these investments, relative to the size of its population and economy, according to US-based research group AidData. Panorama has investigated how this led to cutting-edge technology and skills being transferred to China. The UK was ""far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries"", according to a former head of GCHQ. The BBC was given exclusive early access to data collected by AidData, a research group at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia. A leading specialist in tracking how governments spend money overseas, AidData receives funding from governments and charitable foundations around the world. Some government-backed Chinese investments were purely commercial but others were in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, according to Dr Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. These objectives were laid out by China's communist leaders in a strategic plan 10 years ago, called ""Made In China 2025"". It set ambitious targets for the country to become the industry leader in 10 high-tech sectors, including aerospace, electric vehicles and robotics. This was a far-sighted strategy, according to Prof Keyu Jin of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology: ""It's the longer-term strategic thinking that China has always had, and I'd argue that many other countries also should have."" With access to AidData's research, the BBC has investigated how the purchase of some UK companies has led to technology with military potential to be transferred to China. Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based firm, was one of the companies Panorama looked at. It specialises in semiconductor design - in other words, designing the tiny electronic circuits inside chips that power devices such as computers and smartphones. In 2017, Imagination had recently lost its most important client, Apple, and had seen its share price fall dramatically. It was snapped up for £550m by a private equity firm, Canyon Bridge, based at that time in the US state of California. The Canyon Bridge fund that bought Imagination had one investor - Yitai Capital, whose largest stakeholder is China Reform. This organisation reports to the State Council, the body responsible for carrying out party policies and laws. Two months before Canyon Bridge bought Imagination in the UK, it had tried to buy a semiconductor company in the US. However, that purchase had been blocked by the US's investment-screening laws. The value of Imagination lay in its intellectual property - the expertise of its engineers, amassed over decades. A potential buyer would be buying into this expertise. What is more, the algorithms behind its technology, although developed for other products, could be put to military use in missiles and drones. In his first interview since leaving Imagination, the company's former CEO, Ron Black, says the UK government vetted the deal, and he was told ""unequivocally"" by Canyon Bridge that China Reform would be a passive investor, only interested in making money. However, in 2019, Mr Black says he was summoned to a meeting in Beijing, where he was asked to work directly for China Reform, and oversee the wholesale transfer of Imagination's technology and expertise to China. ""I think [the China Reform representative] said specifically 'from the heads of the British engineers to the Chinese engineers, then lay off the British engineers and you'll make a lot of money',"" says Mr Black. He refused, but he says that several months later, China Reform tried to install four new directors ""with no understanding of semiconductors"" directly onto the board of Imagination Technologies. ""The only attributes they appeared to have was a relationship with China Reform,"" he adds. Convinced that Imagination's technology had the capacity to be used for military purposes, Mr Black began reaching out to contacts in the UK government. He says he was given a sympathetic hearing, but was told this was a private industry matter, and there was not much anyone could do. Fearful about the possible transfer of military-grade technology, Mr Black resigned. At that point, he says, the UK government started to take an interest, and China Reform halted its attempt to install new directors. Mr Black withdrew his resignation but was fired three days later. He was later found by an employment tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed. After he left the company, Imagination's homegrown technology was transferred to China. According to Imagination, its technology is not used in military products. It told Panorama: ""Imagination has always complied with applicable export and trade compliance laws in respect of its commercial licensing of semiconductor IP technology and related transactions."" Canyon Bridge told Panorama ""the Imagination transaction was sourced and led exclusively by Canyon Bridge and its advisers"". Panorama contacted China Reform, but it has not commented on Mr Black's allegations. The Chinese Embassy says its government ""has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations"" and that these enterprises ""also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation - efforts that have been widely welcomed by many countries"". In 2017, the UK had fewer powers to stop the sale of a company such as Imagination to Chinese owners. Two years earlier, China's leader, Xi Jinping, had been welcomed on a state visit, with David Cameron's Conservative government hailing the start of a ""golden era"" in China-UK relations. ""We thought China was basically a very friendly power and there was lots of money to be made,"" says Sir Jeremy Hunt. In 2015 he was health secretary, and later held other government posts, including chancellor of the exchequer and foreign secretary. ""But under the surface, we were beginning to sense a much more assertive China."" The challenge of how to trade with China, while keeping the UK safe, remains an unresolved issue. ""This is the trillion-dollar question,"" says Sir Jeremy Fleming, a former head of GCHQ. The UK has benefited from a trading relationship with China, and from its investment, over the past couple of decades, he says. On the other hand, he adds, the UK has sometimes forgotten that this investment could be used against its own interests. ""My personal view,"" he says, ""is that we have been far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries in science and technology."" Sir Jeremy contrasts the UK's approach with the control exerted by the Chinese: ""They have been very strategic and careful not to allow Western companies to invest or to get involved in key bits of their industry which are strategically important."" Europe as a whole and some US businesses were naive about China in 2017-18, according to John Bolton, former US national security advisor during the first Trump administration. ""There was a reluctance to think we were slipping back into some kind of Cold War,"" he says. Mr Bolton has on several charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. He maintains his innocence. Some experts argue that Beijing did nothing wrong, and that the UK was just short-sighted. China is effectively a one-party state and some argue its autocratic system succeeds because of its long-term strategic planning. The results, seen from China's perspective, have been ""nothing short of remarkable"", says Prof Keyu Jin. ""One of the key advantages of China's political system is the ability to set multi-decade-long goals,"" she says. ""And you do the planning. You do the investment. You set the strategy. You influence the financing. It's not a five-year thing."" In this century, China has been the world's largest overseas lender, to the tune of £1.6tn ($2.1tn) at 2023 prices, AidData's research has revealed. The high point for Chinese overseas investment was during 2016 and 2017, according to Dr Parks. After this point, he says, many countries started strengthening screening mechanisms on national security grounds. The US, Germany and Italy tightened vetting on foreign investment by 2018. The UK followed suit in 2022. Sir Jeremy Fleming is cautiously optimistic that lessons have been learned. ""We have a much stronger regime in place,"" he says. ""But would I say the process is watertight? Absolutely not."" In 2024, a Labour government was elected, but it faced the same issue as its Conservative predecessor - namely, that the UK needed economic growth and China could help. ""One big problem in Europe, including the UK, is that there's not enough investment and funding,"" says Prof Keyu Jin. ""China is very happy to finance some of these projects. And there are lots of areas where there's no real threat of national security."" Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already been . But some Labour MPs are concerned the government has not published its China audit, which it carried out as part of an election manifesto commitment. ""I was promised by the foreign secretary that it would be published,"" says Dame Emily Thornberry MP, the chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Then we hear that the China audit has happened but we're not going to be told about it, we're only going to get a few lines."" The Foreign Office has told Panorama it did not publish its full audit because of its security classification. It says it takes ""a consistent and strategic"" approach to China, the UK's third largest trading partner, it is committed to supporting UK businesses to ""trade securely"", and it will use its powers to protect UK interests."
China-US Relations,Will Starbucks staff strikes hit turnaround plans?,2025-11-12T15:59:31.538Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype4j07xpo,"Starbucks has been working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes. But though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround. Picket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday, as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing. The walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago. Baristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload. ""Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,"" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US. ""You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,"" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May. Starbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the ""vast majority"" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US. During previous coordinated strikes, fewer than 1% of stores participated, the company said, adding that it expected the same turnout this time. But the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment. In recent years the brand has faced consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks. The arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%. He quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal. At the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training. Progress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat. ""We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,"" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts. But the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester. Starbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September. Even after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice. A union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April. The company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would ""significantly affect store operations and customer experience"", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week. ""When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,"" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement. ""Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,"" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30. Unionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months. This continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts. The brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers. ""Happy customers have to come from happy employees,"" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. ""You can't do that top down."" This week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of ""union-busting"" and urging the company to bargain in good faith. Joe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the ""Experience Economy"", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was ""surprised"" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved. ""This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,"" he said."
China-US Relations,Gang jailed for stealing £700k from cash machines,2025-11-26T06:12:13.093Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0pr5q7kg4o,"Six members of a criminal network that stole £700,000 from cash machines across the country have been jailed. Between February and December 2024 the gang, which was based in Romania but operated out of Luton, used sophisticated devices to bypass security systems at cashpoints, investigators said. Late night raids at 51 locations across the UK were carried out to fraudulently withdraw cash in 3,300 separate transactions. Det Insp Dan Barker, from the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), said there was ""no doubt that this group thought they were above the law both here in the UK and in Romania"". After reports were received about fraudulent activity, an investigation was launched by ERSOU which led to detectives uncovering and dismantling the network. An initial five arrests were made in December 2024, with suspects arrested at Luton Airport as they tried to leave the country - and others detained during raids in Luton and Norfolk. Chipboards programmed to bypass cashpoint security measures were seized, along with a cash machine which had been purchased from China. There were indications that new technology was being developed for future offending, ERSOU said. In July, 18 addresses across the Bacau region in Romania were raided with the help of the police in the country and international agencies Europol and Eurojust. Two further arrests were made, with officers seizing a Lamborghini and a Porsche and raiding a stronghold-style property, where the gang's ""FTP"" moniker had been carved into a front gate and printed onto the floor of an outdoor swimming pool. Those arrested were extradited to the UK. Constantin Boghiu, 25, of Kimpton Road, Luton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Alex Militaru, 25, of High Street Watton, Thetford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to two years and five months' imprisonment. Marius Chifan 33, of St Catherines Avenue Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Gabriel Rosu, 33, of Flowers way Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced three and a half years' imprisonment. Razvan Verde, 31, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to launder money, possession of articles for use in fraud and was sentenced to four years and four months' imprisonment. Cristian Cimpoesu, 28, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to a year and a half in prison. All six men were jailed at Luton Crown Court, but in total nine men were convicted in relation to the fraud. Three other members of the group are due to be sentenced at hearings in December and January, with all facing the prospect of deportation after their sentences. Det Insp Barker added: ""This has been a long running operation involving teams from across Europe, and it's positive that these offenders will now be spending spells behind bars."""
China-US Relations,Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry,2025-11-11T00:01:10.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43kyn9d6po,"In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law that saw it take effective control of a Chinese-owned chip company with operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited ""serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia"" that ""posed a threat"". The move allows the Dutch government to ""block decisions if they are harmful or potentially harmful to the company's production"" or to ""the future of Nexperia as a Dutch and European company, and the preservation of this crucial player in Europe's value chain,"" the statement said. The ministry has told the BBC the measure, which is effective for up to a year, does not amount to a takeover of the firm and that the government has no legal control over Nexperia as a result of the action. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want The Hague to revoke its action over Nexperia. ""China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,"" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment. At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called ""legacy"" or ""building block"" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. ""Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,"" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds. Beijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message. ""The narrative was [that, since] Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,"" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China. That didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement. Wingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government. It was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list. According to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's action over Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company earlier in the year. The documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the ""Chinese owner is problematic"". ""It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,"" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents. The Hague denies its actions were a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China. Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this. ""I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,"" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China. ""Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips."" Experts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China. ""This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,"" said Mr Nunlist. European vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time. It is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips. But supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said. ""Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things."" The incident comes as US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year trade truce - a deal which suspended some export bans and rare earth restrictions. But the Nexperia dispute suggests that this newly-minted agreement may be a fragile one. The US is not going to blow up the deal though, according to Mr Nunlist, and Europe doesn't have much leverage especially in this game of supply chain weaponisation. ""This is really politically tricky for both sides, and for Europe because it doesn't want this to end with chip capacity leaving Europe,"" Mr Nunlist said. ""My understanding is that leaders in Brussels were unaware that the Dutch government was planning to make this move and were unhappy with it."" China and the EU remain locked in urgent negotiations to lift export controls on both chips and rare earths. Talks are continuing with China on finding a ""lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows"", EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X over the weekend. But the episode has exposed vulnerabilities in key supply chains - and ties between China and the Netherlands, and in turn the European Union, are likely to remain under pressure until the discord over Nexperia's ownership and operations is fully resolved."
China-US Relations,"US to sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, Trump says ahead of crown prince's visit",2025-11-18T12:50:24.407Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7512rkvg7ro,"The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,"" Trump said. ""They've been a great ally."" The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago. A US intelligence assessment Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince any role in the murder. Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul. While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a ""pariah"" over its human rights record, Biden in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting. Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the ""largest defence sales agreement in history"", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms. Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers. Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s. One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin. During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects."
China-US Relations,Suspected Hezbollah member goes on trial in Germany,2025-11-18T19:00:18.163Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg72r6myz4o,"A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU. The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations. In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a ""foreign operator"" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany. According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running ""an extensive drone programme for some time"". Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had ""systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel"". ""By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units."" To procure such drones ""the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon"", prosecutors said. Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024. The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US. According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers. Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies. Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight. Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added. One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur. Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured. The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder. The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October. Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities."
China-US Relations,The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means,2025-11-16T13:33:18.710Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620qppzlgwo,"South Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States. The US has approved the ""attack submarines"" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday. The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west. Here's what you need to know about the agreement. The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding. In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had ""given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel"". In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha. Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India. South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster. ""I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme. President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose. In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a ""proud achievement"" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North. The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""awake at night"", he added. North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials. In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years. North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme. Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race. ""North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,"" she told the BBC. ""[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension."" It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat. ""South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,"" Dr Yang said. ""What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines."" Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal. Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a ""major change"" which ""means South Korea is now a regional player"". ""The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,"" she said. ""It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries."" For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China. ""Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,"" Dr Yang explained. ""South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea."" US and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea. Beijing must be ""furious"" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said. Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would ""deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides"". Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that ""the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive"". Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline. South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did ""not have the capability"" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use."
China-US Relations,Starmer says China policy cannot continue to blow 'hot and cold',2025-12-01T21:21:40.106Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w7xenlnp1o,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says UK government policy towards China cannot continue to blow ""hot and cold"". Speaking at the annual Lady Mayor's banquet, traditionally used to set out foreign policy for the year ahead, Sir Keir told guests his government will focus on the relationship with China. The speech follows an targeting MPs and parliamentary staff, and comes less than a fortnight before a decision on whether in the capital despite security concerns. The prime minister stressed that being tough on national security will enable the UK to pursue economic opportunities with the world's second biggest economy. Sir Keir's speech in the City of London rejected the ""isolationism"" put forward by opponents of the Chinese government, notably former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who say the state should be treated as an enemy. However, failing to navigate a relationship with China would be ""a dereliction of duty"", the prime minister said, when China is a ""defining force in technology, trade and global governance"". Building a careful relationship would instead bolster the UK's place as a leader on the international stage and help secure UK national interests, he said, while still recognising the ""reality"" that China ""poses national security threats"". ""Instead, for years we have blown hot and cold,"" he said. ""We had the golden age, which then flipped to an Ice Age. We reject that binary choice. ""So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism."" Those security threats were clearly outlined earlier this month, when security services took the unusual step of issuing a warning that specifically identified . The alert explained the profiles were being used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), acting as ""civilian recruitment headhunters"" to target individuals working in British politics ""at scale"", including economists and think tank employees as well as people in Parliament. A Chinese Embassy spokesperson denied the accusations of espionage and said they were ""pure fabrication"" that were ""undermining China-UK relations"". , which would be the biggest in Europe, sitting on a site at Royal Mint Court, which is close to the City of London and fibre optic cables carrying vast quantities of highly sensitive data. Housing Secretary Steve Reed has the final say and is expected to give the green light to the plans, following consultation with MI5 and MI6, in a decision opposed by Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. At the speech in London's Guildhall, Sir Keir insisted there would not be any ""trade-off"" between security and economic access with China, appearing to rule out trade on areas of defence, AI or critical national infrastructure. ""Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty,"" he said. ""But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas."" These areas would include financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals and luxury goods, he said, adding they were: ""Great British success stories –  the export opportunities are huge and we will back you to seize them."" to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

China-US Relations,"Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in Delhi",2025-12-04T14:56:51.122Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q2vpggr9o,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries. Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil. It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war. India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet. Why are relations with India key for the Kremlin? Well, for a start, look at the numbers: That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil. India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian. That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market. India was happy. Washington less so. Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying. For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers. But there's geopolitics at play, too. The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed. Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that. So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a ""multi-polar world"". Russia lauds its ""no limits partnership"" with China. It is just as vocal about its ""special and privileged strategic partnership"" with India. That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union. ""I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,"" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov. ""We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy. ""But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India."" This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi. Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions. India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape. Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him. As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict. This was India's ""strategic autonomy"" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time. That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here. Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his ""true friend"". But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine. And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe. ""For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,"" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank. Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia. Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades. Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct. With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade. Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing. But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets. India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix. Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible. But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin. Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance. ""Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,"" GTRI said. Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy. He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West. ""Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,"" GTRI said."
China-US Relations,Trump administration says Europe faces 'civilisational erasure',2025-12-05T12:07:34.641Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04vdengk3do,"US President Donald Trump's administration has warned that Europe faces ""civilisational erasure"" and questioned whether certain nations can remain reliable allies, in a new strategy document that puts a particular focus on the continent. The 33-page National Security Strategy sees the US leader outline his vision for the world and how he will wield US military and economic power to work towards it. Trump described the document as a ""roadmap"" to ensure the US remains ""the greatest and most successful nation in human history"". European politicians have begun to react, with Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying his country did not need ""outside advice"". A formal National Security Strategy is typically released by presidents once per term. It can form a framework for future policies and budgets, as well as signalling to the world where the president's priorities lie. The new document follows similar rhetoric to earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy. The new report doubles down on Trump's point of view, calling for the restoration of ""Western identity"", combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and focusing more on US priorities such as stopping drug cartels. Focusing on Europe, it asserts that if current trends continue the continent would be ""unrecognisable in 20 years or less"" and its economic issues are ""eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure"". ""It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,"" the document states. It also accused the EU and ""other transnational bodies"" of carrying out activities that ""undermine political liberty and sovereignty"". It said migration policies were ""creating strife"" and that other issues included ""censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence"". Conversely, the document hails the growing influence of ""patriotic European parties"" and says ""America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit"". The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been . Germany's Wadephul stressed that the ""United States is and will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance"", but said ""this alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues"". ""I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany,"" he added. Referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the document says Europe has a lack of ""self-confidence"" in its relationship with Russia. Managing European relations with Russia will require significant US involvement, the document says, adding it is a core US interest for hostilities in Ukraine to end. The Trump administration has proposed a plan to end the war, the original version of which called for Ukraine to hand over some territory to the de facto control of Russia. However, Trump's envoy has presented a modified version in Moscow. that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it by force. The White House strategy document repeatedly references the Western Hemisphere, and the need for the US to protect itself from outside threats. The document says there must be a readjustment of ""our global military presence to address urgent threats in our Hemisphere"". To do this, the strategy calls for moving assets away from theatres which are less important to American national security than they once were. This re-prioritising of military power can be seen already in the Caribbean, where the US military has a growing presence and has carried out which the government alleges are carrying drugs. The world's largest warship, the USS Gerald Ford, is currently based in the Caribbean along with its strike group. Away from the western hemisphere, the Trump administration singles out the South China Sea as a key shipping passage that has major implications for the US economy, and the document says the US will ""harden and strengthen our military presence in the Western Pacific"". The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan. It says ""deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority"". China views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. The strategy also talks of pushing for a stronger industrial base in the US and less reliance on foreign technologies, which matches some of the moves the Trump administration has taken with its ."
China-US Relations,Thai king becomes country's first monarch to visit China,2025-11-13T09:09:02.801Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l750p7y5no,"King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand has arrived in China on Thursday, the first ever visit by a reigning Thai monarch. The visit is at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping to celebrate the 50th anniversary of both countries establishing diplomatic ties for the first time in 1975. China is believed to have been pushing for this visit for some years. The Thai government said in a statement that the trip ""underlines the deep-rooted friendship and mutual understanding shared between Thailand and China at all levels"". In Beijing, the king and his wife Queen Suthida will visit local landmarks like the Lingguang Buddhist Temple and the Beijing Aerospace City. President Xi and his wife will also host a state banquet for the Thai royals. This is the first major state visit by King Vajiralongkorn since he came to the throne nine years ago – in April he also made a trip to Bhutan. By contrast the most high-profile overseas trips made by his father King Bhumibol were to the United States in the 1960s, when Thailand was feted as a crucial Cold War partner, and a vital base for US military operations in Indochina. Thailand is still officially a military ally of the US, but relations with China have grown steadily closer in recent years, while those with Washington have been frayed by US criticism of human rights in Thailand, by President Trump's tariffs, and a perception that the US is no longer as committed as it once was to its Asian friends. China is Thailand's biggest trading partner, and increasingly a rival to the US as a source of military equipment. Many Thais can trace their ancestry to migrants who came from China, and the Chinese government often highlights what it calls their ""brotherly"" or ""family"" relations. The importance of those ties to Thailand was underlined earlier this year when the Thai authorities deported 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers back to China, in defiance of a warning not to do so by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Then in August an exhibition at Bangkok's main arts centre featuring Uyghur and Tibetan artists was censored following complaints by Chinese diplomats. The Thai government was spurred by Chinese pressure into taking action against scam compounds operating along its border with Myanmar, and objections by China are presumed to have been one of the factors which blocked a proposal to legalise casinos in Thailand. Despite the lack of a Thai royal visit before this one, the Thai monarchy has played a significant role in sustaining Thai-Chinese relations through the work of the king's younger sister, Princess Sirindhorn, who has studied Chinese art and language for the past 45 years, and been a frequent visitor to China."
China-US Relations,A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree,2025-11-17T23:01:18.831Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o,"Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications. But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. ""Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'"" he remembers. ""I was astonished!"" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret. But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: ""There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence."" The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA. Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale. Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment. High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018. Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent. ""For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,"" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. ""And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses."" AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China. A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the . The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access. AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries. ""China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,"" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities. ""The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,"" Mr Shih says. ""This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis."" Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025. In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China. Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it ""stayed very much alive"" as a guiding strategy. ""There are all kinds of plans still being published,"" he says, ""including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan."" At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating ""high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement"" until 2030. AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how . The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA. AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy. ""At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,"" he says. ""I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen."" However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts. ""The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,"" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC. ""Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation."" China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment. In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company. It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech. Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company. That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing. Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets. Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past. ""We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,"" she says. ""Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this."" Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China. ""There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,"" she says. ""Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe."" If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over? ""No! There's gonna be multiple laps,"" maintains Brad Parks. ""There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital. ""So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. ""They're going to move from defence to offence."""
China-US Relations,"China's investment spree in UK gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC told",2025-11-17T05:49:13.911Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmy5d7k84o,"China has financed tens of billions of pounds' worth of investment in UK businesses and projects this century, some of which gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC Panorama has learned. The spending spree - worth £45bn ($59bn) at 2023 prices - was at its height following a 2015 Chinese state directive, aimed at making the country a global leader in high-tech industries. The UK has been the top destination among G7 nations for these investments, relative to the size of its population and economy, according to US-based research group AidData. Panorama has investigated how this led to cutting-edge technology and skills being transferred to China. The UK was ""far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries"", according to a former head of GCHQ. The BBC was given exclusive early access to data collected by AidData, a research group at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia. A leading specialist in tracking how governments spend money overseas, AidData receives funding from governments and charitable foundations around the world. Some government-backed Chinese investments were purely commercial but others were in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, according to Dr Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. These objectives were laid out by China's communist leaders in a strategic plan 10 years ago, called ""Made In China 2025"". It set ambitious targets for the country to become the industry leader in 10 high-tech sectors, including aerospace, electric vehicles and robotics. This was a far-sighted strategy, according to Prof Keyu Jin of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology: ""It's the longer-term strategic thinking that China has always had, and I'd argue that many other countries also should have."" With access to AidData's research, the BBC has investigated how the purchase of some UK companies has led to technology with military potential to be transferred to China. Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based firm, was one of the companies Panorama looked at. It specialises in semiconductor design - in other words, designing the tiny electronic circuits inside chips that power devices such as computers and smartphones. In 2017, Imagination had recently lost its most important client, Apple, and had seen its share price fall dramatically. It was snapped up for £550m by a private equity firm, Canyon Bridge, based at that time in the US state of California. The Canyon Bridge fund that bought Imagination had one investor - Yitai Capital, whose largest stakeholder is China Reform. This organisation reports to the State Council, the body responsible for carrying out party policies and laws. Two months before Canyon Bridge bought Imagination in the UK, it had tried to buy a semiconductor company in the US. However, that purchase had been blocked by the US's investment-screening laws. The value of Imagination lay in its intellectual property - the expertise of its engineers, amassed over decades. A potential buyer would be buying into this expertise. What is more, the algorithms behind its technology, although developed for other products, could be put to military use in missiles and drones. In his first interview since leaving Imagination, the company's former CEO, Ron Black, says the UK government vetted the deal, and he was told ""unequivocally"" by Canyon Bridge that China Reform would be a passive investor, only interested in making money. However, in 2019, Mr Black says he was summoned to a meeting in Beijing, where he was asked to work directly for China Reform, and oversee the wholesale transfer of Imagination's technology and expertise to China. ""I think [the China Reform representative] said specifically 'from the heads of the British engineers to the Chinese engineers, then lay off the British engineers and you'll make a lot of money',"" says Mr Black. He refused, but he says that several months later, China Reform tried to install four new directors ""with no understanding of semiconductors"" directly onto the board of Imagination Technologies. ""The only attributes they appeared to have was a relationship with China Reform,"" he adds. Convinced that Imagination's technology had the capacity to be used for military purposes, Mr Black began reaching out to contacts in the UK government. He says he was given a sympathetic hearing, but was told this was a private industry matter, and there was not much anyone could do. Fearful about the possible transfer of military-grade technology, Mr Black resigned. At that point, he says, the UK government started to take an interest, and China Reform halted its attempt to install new directors. Mr Black withdrew his resignation but was fired three days later. He was later found by an employment tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed. After he left the company, Imagination's homegrown technology was transferred to China. According to Imagination, its technology is not used in military products. It told Panorama: ""Imagination has always complied with applicable export and trade compliance laws in respect of its commercial licensing of semiconductor IP technology and related transactions."" Canyon Bridge told Panorama ""the Imagination transaction was sourced and led exclusively by Canyon Bridge and its advisers"". Panorama contacted China Reform, but it has not commented on Mr Black's allegations. The Chinese Embassy says its government ""has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations"" and that these enterprises ""also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation - efforts that have been widely welcomed by many countries"". In 2017, the UK had fewer powers to stop the sale of a company such as Imagination to Chinese owners. Two years earlier, China's leader, Xi Jinping, had been welcomed on a state visit, with David Cameron's Conservative government hailing the start of a ""golden era"" in China-UK relations. ""We thought China was basically a very friendly power and there was lots of money to be made,"" says Sir Jeremy Hunt. In 2015 he was health secretary, and later held other government posts, including chancellor of the exchequer and foreign secretary. ""But under the surface, we were beginning to sense a much more assertive China."" The challenge of how to trade with China, while keeping the UK safe, remains an unresolved issue. ""This is the trillion-dollar question,"" says Sir Jeremy Fleming, a former head of GCHQ. The UK has benefited from a trading relationship with China, and from its investment, over the past couple of decades, he says. On the other hand, he adds, the UK has sometimes forgotten that this investment could be used against its own interests. ""My personal view,"" he says, ""is that we have been far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries in science and technology."" Sir Jeremy contrasts the UK's approach with the control exerted by the Chinese: ""They have been very strategic and careful not to allow Western companies to invest or to get involved in key bits of their industry which are strategically important."" Europe as a whole and some US businesses were naive about China in 2017-18, according to John Bolton, former US national security advisor during the first Trump administration. ""There was a reluctance to think we were slipping back into some kind of Cold War,"" he says. Mr Bolton has on several charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. He maintains his innocence. Some experts argue that Beijing did nothing wrong, and that the UK was just short-sighted. China is effectively a one-party state and some argue its autocratic system succeeds because of its long-term strategic planning. The results, seen from China's perspective, have been ""nothing short of remarkable"", says Prof Keyu Jin. ""One of the key advantages of China's political system is the ability to set multi-decade-long goals,"" she says. ""And you do the planning. You do the investment. You set the strategy. You influence the financing. It's not a five-year thing."" In this century, China has been the world's largest overseas lender, to the tune of £1.6tn ($2.1tn) at 2023 prices, AidData's research has revealed. The high point for Chinese overseas investment was during 2016 and 2017, according to Dr Parks. After this point, he says, many countries started strengthening screening mechanisms on national security grounds. The US, Germany and Italy tightened vetting on foreign investment by 2018. The UK followed suit in 2022. Sir Jeremy Fleming is cautiously optimistic that lessons have been learned. ""We have a much stronger regime in place,"" he says. ""But would I say the process is watertight? Absolutely not."" In 2024, a Labour government was elected, but it faced the same issue as its Conservative predecessor - namely, that the UK needed economic growth and China could help. ""One big problem in Europe, including the UK, is that there's not enough investment and funding,"" says Prof Keyu Jin. ""China is very happy to finance some of these projects. And there are lots of areas where there's no real threat of national security."" Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already been . But some Labour MPs are concerned the government has not published its China audit, which it carried out as part of an election manifesto commitment. ""I was promised by the foreign secretary that it would be published,"" says Dame Emily Thornberry MP, the chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Then we hear that the China audit has happened but we're not going to be told about it, we're only going to get a few lines."" The Foreign Office has told Panorama it did not publish its full audit because of its security classification. It says it takes ""a consistent and strategic"" approach to China, the UK's third largest trading partner, it is committed to supporting UK businesses to ""trade securely"", and it will use its powers to protect UK interests."
China-US Relations,Will Starbucks staff strikes hit turnaround plans?,2025-11-12T15:59:31.538Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype4j07xpo,"Starbucks has been working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes. But though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround. Picket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday, as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing. The walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago. Baristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload. ""Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,"" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US. ""You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,"" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May. Starbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the ""vast majority"" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US. During previous coordinated strikes, fewer than 1% of stores participated, the company said, adding that it expected the same turnout this time. But the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment. In recent years the brand has faced consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks. The arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%. He quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal. At the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training. Progress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat. ""We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,"" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts. But the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester. Starbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September. Even after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice. A union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April. The company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would ""significantly affect store operations and customer experience"", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week. ""When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,"" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement. ""Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,"" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30. Unionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months. This continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts. The brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers. ""Happy customers have to come from happy employees,"" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. ""You can't do that top down."" This week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of ""union-busting"" and urging the company to bargain in good faith. Joe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the ""Experience Economy"", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was ""surprised"" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved. ""This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,"" he said."
China-US Relations,Gang jailed for stealing £700k from cash machines,2025-11-26T06:12:13.093Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0pr5q7kg4o,"Six members of a criminal network that stole £700,000 from cash machines across the country have been jailed. Between February and December 2024 the gang, which was based in Romania but operated out of Luton, used sophisticated devices to bypass security systems at cashpoints, investigators said. Late night raids at 51 locations across the UK were carried out to fraudulently withdraw cash in 3,300 separate transactions. Det Insp Dan Barker, from the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), said there was ""no doubt that this group thought they were above the law both here in the UK and in Romania"". After reports were received about fraudulent activity, an investigation was launched by ERSOU which led to detectives uncovering and dismantling the network. An initial five arrests were made in December 2024, with suspects arrested at Luton Airport as they tried to leave the country - and others detained during raids in Luton and Norfolk. Chipboards programmed to bypass cashpoint security measures were seized, along with a cash machine which had been purchased from China. There were indications that new technology was being developed for future offending, ERSOU said. In July, 18 addresses across the Bacau region in Romania were raided with the help of the police in the country and international agencies Europol and Eurojust. Two further arrests were made, with officers seizing a Lamborghini and a Porsche and raiding a stronghold-style property, where the gang's ""FTP"" moniker had been carved into a front gate and printed onto the floor of an outdoor swimming pool. Those arrested were extradited to the UK. Constantin Boghiu, 25, of Kimpton Road, Luton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Alex Militaru, 25, of High Street Watton, Thetford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to two years and five months' imprisonment. Marius Chifan 33, of St Catherines Avenue Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Gabriel Rosu, 33, of Flowers way Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced three and a half years' imprisonment. Razvan Verde, 31, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to launder money, possession of articles for use in fraud and was sentenced to four years and four months' imprisonment. Cristian Cimpoesu, 28, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to a year and a half in prison. All six men were jailed at Luton Crown Court, but in total nine men were convicted in relation to the fraud. Three other members of the group are due to be sentenced at hearings in December and January, with all facing the prospect of deportation after their sentences. Det Insp Barker added: ""This has been a long running operation involving teams from across Europe, and it's positive that these offenders will now be spending spells behind bars."""
China-US Relations,Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry,2025-11-11T00:01:10.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43kyn9d6po,"In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law that saw it take effective control of a Chinese-owned chip company with operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited ""serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia"" that ""posed a threat"". The move allows the Dutch government to ""block decisions if they are harmful or potentially harmful to the company's production"" or to ""the future of Nexperia as a Dutch and European company, and the preservation of this crucial player in Europe's value chain,"" the statement said. The ministry has told the BBC the measure, which is effective for up to a year, does not amount to a takeover of the firm and that the government has no legal control over Nexperia as a result of the action. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want The Hague to revoke its action over Nexperia. ""China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,"" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment. At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called ""legacy"" or ""building block"" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. ""Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,"" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds. Beijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message. ""The narrative was [that, since] Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,"" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China. That didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement. Wingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government. It was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list. According to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's action over Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company earlier in the year. The documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the ""Chinese owner is problematic"". ""It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,"" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents. The Hague denies its actions were a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China. Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this. ""I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,"" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China. ""Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips."" Experts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China. ""This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,"" said Mr Nunlist. European vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time. It is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips. But supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said. ""Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things."" The incident comes as US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year trade truce - a deal which suspended some export bans and rare earth restrictions. But the Nexperia dispute suggests that this newly-minted agreement may be a fragile one. The US is not going to blow up the deal though, according to Mr Nunlist, and Europe doesn't have much leverage especially in this game of supply chain weaponisation. ""This is really politically tricky for both sides, and for Europe because it doesn't want this to end with chip capacity leaving Europe,"" Mr Nunlist said. ""My understanding is that leaders in Brussels were unaware that the Dutch government was planning to make this move and were unhappy with it."" China and the EU remain locked in urgent negotiations to lift export controls on both chips and rare earths. Talks are continuing with China on finding a ""lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows"", EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X over the weekend. But the episode has exposed vulnerabilities in key supply chains - and ties between China and the Netherlands, and in turn the European Union, are likely to remain under pressure until the discord over Nexperia's ownership and operations is fully resolved."
China-US Relations,"US to sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, Trump says ahead of crown prince's visit",2025-11-18T12:50:24.407Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7512rkvg7ro,"The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,"" Trump said. ""They've been a great ally."" The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago. A US intelligence assessment Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince any role in the murder. Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul. While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a ""pariah"" over its human rights record, Biden in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting. Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the ""largest defence sales agreement in history"", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms. Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers. Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s. One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin. During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects."
China-US Relations,Suspected Hezbollah member goes on trial in Germany,2025-11-18T19:00:18.163Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg72r6myz4o,"A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU. The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations. In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a ""foreign operator"" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany. According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running ""an extensive drone programme for some time"". Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had ""systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel"". ""By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units."" To procure such drones ""the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon"", prosecutors said. Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024. The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US. According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers. Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies. Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight. Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added. One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur. Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured. The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder. The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October. Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities."
China-US Relations,The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means,2025-11-16T13:33:18.710Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620qppzlgwo,"South Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States. The US has approved the ""attack submarines"" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday. The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west. Here's what you need to know about the agreement. The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding. In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had ""given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel"". In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha. Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India. South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster. ""I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme. President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose. In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a ""proud achievement"" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North. The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""awake at night"", he added. North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials. In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years. North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme. Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race. ""North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,"" she told the BBC. ""[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension."" It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat. ""South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,"" Dr Yang said. ""What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines."" Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal. Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a ""major change"" which ""means South Korea is now a regional player"". ""The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,"" she said. ""It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries."" For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China. ""Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,"" Dr Yang explained. ""South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea."" US and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea. Beijing must be ""furious"" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said. Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would ""deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides"". Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that ""the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive"". Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline. South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did ""not have the capability"" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use."
China-US Relations,Starmer says China policy cannot continue to blow 'hot and cold',2025-12-01T21:21:40.106Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w7xenlnp1o,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says UK government policy towards China cannot continue to blow ""hot and cold"". Speaking at the annual Lady Mayor's banquet, traditionally used to set out foreign policy for the year ahead, Sir Keir told guests his government will focus on the relationship with China. The speech follows an targeting MPs and parliamentary staff, and comes less than a fortnight before a decision on whether in the capital despite security concerns. The prime minister stressed that being tough on national security will enable the UK to pursue economic opportunities with the world's second biggest economy. Sir Keir's speech in the City of London rejected the ""isolationism"" put forward by opponents of the Chinese government, notably former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who say the state should be treated as an enemy. However, failing to navigate a relationship with China would be ""a dereliction of duty"", the prime minister said, when China is a ""defining force in technology, trade and global governance"". Building a careful relationship would instead bolster the UK's place as a leader on the international stage and help secure UK national interests, he said, while still recognising the ""reality"" that China ""poses national security threats"". ""Instead, for years we have blown hot and cold,"" he said. ""We had the golden age, which then flipped to an Ice Age. We reject that binary choice. ""So our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism."" Those security threats were clearly outlined earlier this month, when security services took the unusual step of issuing a warning that specifically identified . The alert explained the profiles were being used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), acting as ""civilian recruitment headhunters"" to target individuals working in British politics ""at scale"", including economists and think tank employees as well as people in Parliament. A Chinese Embassy spokesperson denied the accusations of espionage and said they were ""pure fabrication"" that were ""undermining China-UK relations"". , which would be the biggest in Europe, sitting on a site at Royal Mint Court, which is close to the City of London and fibre optic cables carrying vast quantities of highly sensitive data. Housing Secretary Steve Reed has the final say and is expected to give the green light to the plans, following consultation with MI5 and MI6, in a decision opposed by Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. At the speech in London's Guildhall, Sir Keir insisted there would not be any ""trade-off"" between security and economic access with China, appearing to rule out trade on areas of defence, AI or critical national infrastructure. ""Protecting our security is non-negotiable - our first duty,"" he said. ""But by taking tough steps to keep us secure, we enable ourselves to cooperate in other areas."" These areas would include financial and professional services, creative industries, pharmaceuticals and luxury goods, he said, adding they were: ""Great British success stories –  the export opportunities are huge and we will back you to seize them."" to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

China-US Relations,"Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in Delhi",2025-12-04T14:56:51.122Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q2vpggr9o,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries. Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil. It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war. India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet. Why are relations with India key for the Kremlin? Well, for a start, look at the numbers: That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil. India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian. That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market. India was happy. Washington less so. Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying. For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers. But there's geopolitics at play, too. The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed. Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that. So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a ""multi-polar world"". Russia lauds its ""no limits partnership"" with China. It is just as vocal about its ""special and privileged strategic partnership"" with India. That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union. ""I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,"" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov. ""We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy. ""But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India."" This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi. Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions. India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape. Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him. As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict. This was India's ""strategic autonomy"" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time. That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here. Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his ""true friend"". But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine. And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe. ""For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,"" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank. Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia. Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades. Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct. With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade. Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing. But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets. India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix. Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible. But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin. Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance. ""Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,"" GTRI said. Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy. He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West. ""Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,"" GTRI said."
China-US Relations,Trump administration says Europe faces 'civilisational erasure',2025-12-05T12:07:34.641Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04vdengk3do,"US President Donald Trump's administration has warned that Europe faces ""civilisational erasure"" and questioned whether certain nations can remain reliable allies, in a new strategy document that puts a particular focus on the continent. The 33-page National Security Strategy sees the US leader outline his vision for the world and how he will wield US military and economic power to work towards it. Trump described the document as a ""roadmap"" to ensure the US remains ""the greatest and most successful nation in human history"". European politicians have begun to react, with Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying his country did not need ""outside advice"". A formal National Security Strategy is typically released by presidents once per term. It can form a framework for future policies and budgets, as well as signalling to the world where the president's priorities lie. The new document follows similar rhetoric to earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy. The new report doubles down on Trump's point of view, calling for the restoration of ""Western identity"", combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and focusing more on US priorities such as stopping drug cartels. Focusing on Europe, it asserts that if current trends continue the continent would be ""unrecognisable in 20 years or less"" and its economic issues are ""eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure"". ""It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,"" the document states. It also accused the EU and ""other transnational bodies"" of carrying out activities that ""undermine political liberty and sovereignty"". It said migration policies were ""creating strife"" and that other issues included ""censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence"". Conversely, the document hails the growing influence of ""patriotic European parties"" and says ""America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit"". The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been . Germany's Wadephul stressed that the ""United States is and will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance"", but said ""this alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues"". ""I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany,"" he added. Referring to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the document says Europe has a lack of ""self-confidence"" in its relationship with Russia. Managing European relations with Russia will require significant US involvement, the document says, adding it is a core US interest for hostilities in Ukraine to end. The Trump administration has proposed a plan to end the war, the original version of which called for Ukraine to hand over some territory to the de facto control of Russia. However, Trump's envoy has presented a modified version in Moscow. that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it by force. The White House strategy document repeatedly references the Western Hemisphere, and the need for the US to protect itself from outside threats. The document says there must be a readjustment of ""our global military presence to address urgent threats in our Hemisphere"". To do this, the strategy calls for moving assets away from theatres which are less important to American national security than they once were. This re-prioritising of military power can be seen already in the Caribbean, where the US military has a growing presence and has carried out which the government alleges are carrying drugs. The world's largest warship, the USS Gerald Ford, is currently based in the Caribbean along with its strike group. Away from the western hemisphere, the Trump administration singles out the South China Sea as a key shipping passage that has major implications for the US economy, and the document says the US will ""harden and strengthen our military presence in the Western Pacific"". The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan. It says ""deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority"". China views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunite"" with it. The strategy also talks of pushing for a stronger industrial base in the US and less reliance on foreign technologies, which matches some of the moves the Trump administration has taken with its ."
China-US Relations,Thai king becomes country's first monarch to visit China,2025-11-13T09:09:02.801Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l750p7y5no,"King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand has arrived in China on Thursday, the first ever visit by a reigning Thai monarch. The visit is at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping to celebrate the 50th anniversary of both countries establishing diplomatic ties for the first time in 1975. China is believed to have been pushing for this visit for some years. The Thai government said in a statement that the trip ""underlines the deep-rooted friendship and mutual understanding shared between Thailand and China at all levels"". In Beijing, the king and his wife Queen Suthida will visit local landmarks like the Lingguang Buddhist Temple and the Beijing Aerospace City. President Xi and his wife will also host a state banquet for the Thai royals. This is the first major state visit by King Vajiralongkorn since he came to the throne nine years ago – in April he also made a trip to Bhutan. By contrast the most high-profile overseas trips made by his father King Bhumibol were to the United States in the 1960s, when Thailand was feted as a crucial Cold War partner, and a vital base for US military operations in Indochina. Thailand is still officially a military ally of the US, but relations with China have grown steadily closer in recent years, while those with Washington have been frayed by US criticism of human rights in Thailand, by President Trump's tariffs, and a perception that the US is no longer as committed as it once was to its Asian friends. China is Thailand's biggest trading partner, and increasingly a rival to the US as a source of military equipment. Many Thais can trace their ancestry to migrants who came from China, and the Chinese government often highlights what it calls their ""brotherly"" or ""family"" relations. The importance of those ties to Thailand was underlined earlier this year when the Thai authorities deported 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers back to China, in defiance of a warning not to do so by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Then in August an exhibition at Bangkok's main arts centre featuring Uyghur and Tibetan artists was censored following complaints by Chinese diplomats. The Thai government was spurred by Chinese pressure into taking action against scam compounds operating along its border with Myanmar, and objections by China are presumed to have been one of the factors which blocked a proposal to legalise casinos in Thailand. Despite the lack of a Thai royal visit before this one, the Thai monarchy has played a significant role in sustaining Thai-Chinese relations through the work of the king's younger sister, Princess Sirindhorn, who has studied Chinese art and language for the past 45 years, and been a frequent visitor to China."
China-US Relations,A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree,2025-11-17T23:01:18.831Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o,"Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications. But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. ""Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'"" he remembers. ""I was astonished!"" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret. But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: ""There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence."" The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA. Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale. Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment. High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018. Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent. ""For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,"" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. ""And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses."" AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China. A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the . The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access. AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries. ""China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,"" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities. ""The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,"" Mr Shih says. ""This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis."" Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025. In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China. Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it ""stayed very much alive"" as a guiding strategy. ""There are all kinds of plans still being published,"" he says, ""including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan."" At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating ""high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement"" until 2030. AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how . The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA. AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy. ""At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,"" he says. ""I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen."" However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts. ""The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,"" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC. ""Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation."" China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment. In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company. It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech. Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company. That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing. Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets. Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past. ""We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,"" she says. ""Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this."" Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China. ""There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,"" she says. ""Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe."" If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over? ""No! There's gonna be multiple laps,"" maintains Brad Parks. ""There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital. ""So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. ""They're going to move from defence to offence."""
China-US Relations,"China's investment spree in UK gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC told",2025-11-17T05:49:13.911Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmy5d7k84o,"China has financed tens of billions of pounds' worth of investment in UK businesses and projects this century, some of which gave it access to military-grade technology, BBC Panorama has learned. The spending spree - worth £45bn ($59bn) at 2023 prices - was at its height following a 2015 Chinese state directive, aimed at making the country a global leader in high-tech industries. The UK has been the top destination among G7 nations for these investments, relative to the size of its population and economy, according to US-based research group AidData. Panorama has investigated how this led to cutting-edge technology and skills being transferred to China. The UK was ""far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries"", according to a former head of GCHQ. The BBC was given exclusive early access to data collected by AidData, a research group at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia. A leading specialist in tracking how governments spend money overseas, AidData receives funding from governments and charitable foundations around the world. Some government-backed Chinese investments were purely commercial but others were in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, according to Dr Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. These objectives were laid out by China's communist leaders in a strategic plan 10 years ago, called ""Made In China 2025"". It set ambitious targets for the country to become the industry leader in 10 high-tech sectors, including aerospace, electric vehicles and robotics. This was a far-sighted strategy, according to Prof Keyu Jin of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology: ""It's the longer-term strategic thinking that China has always had, and I'd argue that many other countries also should have."" With access to AidData's research, the BBC has investigated how the purchase of some UK companies has led to technology with military potential to be transferred to China. Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based firm, was one of the companies Panorama looked at. It specialises in semiconductor design - in other words, designing the tiny electronic circuits inside chips that power devices such as computers and smartphones. In 2017, Imagination had recently lost its most important client, Apple, and had seen its share price fall dramatically. It was snapped up for £550m by a private equity firm, Canyon Bridge, based at that time in the US state of California. The Canyon Bridge fund that bought Imagination had one investor - Yitai Capital, whose largest stakeholder is China Reform. This organisation reports to the State Council, the body responsible for carrying out party policies and laws. Two months before Canyon Bridge bought Imagination in the UK, it had tried to buy a semiconductor company in the US. However, that purchase had been blocked by the US's investment-screening laws. The value of Imagination lay in its intellectual property - the expertise of its engineers, amassed over decades. A potential buyer would be buying into this expertise. What is more, the algorithms behind its technology, although developed for other products, could be put to military use in missiles and drones. In his first interview since leaving Imagination, the company's former CEO, Ron Black, says the UK government vetted the deal, and he was told ""unequivocally"" by Canyon Bridge that China Reform would be a passive investor, only interested in making money. However, in 2019, Mr Black says he was summoned to a meeting in Beijing, where he was asked to work directly for China Reform, and oversee the wholesale transfer of Imagination's technology and expertise to China. ""I think [the China Reform representative] said specifically 'from the heads of the British engineers to the Chinese engineers, then lay off the British engineers and you'll make a lot of money',"" says Mr Black. He refused, but he says that several months later, China Reform tried to install four new directors ""with no understanding of semiconductors"" directly onto the board of Imagination Technologies. ""The only attributes they appeared to have was a relationship with China Reform,"" he adds. Convinced that Imagination's technology had the capacity to be used for military purposes, Mr Black began reaching out to contacts in the UK government. He says he was given a sympathetic hearing, but was told this was a private industry matter, and there was not much anyone could do. Fearful about the possible transfer of military-grade technology, Mr Black resigned. At that point, he says, the UK government started to take an interest, and China Reform halted its attempt to install new directors. Mr Black withdrew his resignation but was fired three days later. He was later found by an employment tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed. After he left the company, Imagination's homegrown technology was transferred to China. According to Imagination, its technology is not used in military products. It told Panorama: ""Imagination has always complied with applicable export and trade compliance laws in respect of its commercial licensing of semiconductor IP technology and related transactions."" Canyon Bridge told Panorama ""the Imagination transaction was sourced and led exclusively by Canyon Bridge and its advisers"". Panorama contacted China Reform, but it has not commented on Mr Black's allegations. The Chinese Embassy says its government ""has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations"" and that these enterprises ""also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation - efforts that have been widely welcomed by many countries"". In 2017, the UK had fewer powers to stop the sale of a company such as Imagination to Chinese owners. Two years earlier, China's leader, Xi Jinping, had been welcomed on a state visit, with David Cameron's Conservative government hailing the start of a ""golden era"" in China-UK relations. ""We thought China was basically a very friendly power and there was lots of money to be made,"" says Sir Jeremy Hunt. In 2015 he was health secretary, and later held other government posts, including chancellor of the exchequer and foreign secretary. ""But under the surface, we were beginning to sense a much more assertive China."" The challenge of how to trade with China, while keeping the UK safe, remains an unresolved issue. ""This is the trillion-dollar question,"" says Sir Jeremy Fleming, a former head of GCHQ. The UK has benefited from a trading relationship with China, and from its investment, over the past couple of decades, he says. On the other hand, he adds, the UK has sometimes forgotten that this investment could be used against its own interests. ""My personal view,"" he says, ""is that we have been far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries in science and technology."" Sir Jeremy contrasts the UK's approach with the control exerted by the Chinese: ""They have been very strategic and careful not to allow Western companies to invest or to get involved in key bits of their industry which are strategically important."" Europe as a whole and some US businesses were naive about China in 2017-18, according to John Bolton, former US national security advisor during the first Trump administration. ""There was a reluctance to think we were slipping back into some kind of Cold War,"" he says. Mr Bolton has on several charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. He maintains his innocence. Some experts argue that Beijing did nothing wrong, and that the UK was just short-sighted. China is effectively a one-party state and some argue its autocratic system succeeds because of its long-term strategic planning. The results, seen from China's perspective, have been ""nothing short of remarkable"", says Prof Keyu Jin. ""One of the key advantages of China's political system is the ability to set multi-decade-long goals,"" she says. ""And you do the planning. You do the investment. You set the strategy. You influence the financing. It's not a five-year thing."" In this century, China has been the world's largest overseas lender, to the tune of £1.6tn ($2.1tn) at 2023 prices, AidData's research has revealed. The high point for Chinese overseas investment was during 2016 and 2017, according to Dr Parks. After this point, he says, many countries started strengthening screening mechanisms on national security grounds. The US, Germany and Italy tightened vetting on foreign investment by 2018. The UK followed suit in 2022. Sir Jeremy Fleming is cautiously optimistic that lessons have been learned. ""We have a much stronger regime in place,"" he says. ""But would I say the process is watertight? Absolutely not."" In 2024, a Labour government was elected, but it faced the same issue as its Conservative predecessor - namely, that the UK needed economic growth and China could help. ""One big problem in Europe, including the UK, is that there's not enough investment and funding,"" says Prof Keyu Jin. ""China is very happy to finance some of these projects.

But some Labour MPs are concerned the government has not published its China audit, which it carried out as part of an election manifesto commitment. ""I was promised by the foreign secretary that it would be published,"" says Dame Emily Thornberry MP, the chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Then we hear that the China audit has happened but we're not going to be told about it, we're only going to get a few lines.""

China-US Relations,Will Starbucks staff strikes hit turnaround plans?,2025-11-12T15:59:31.538Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ype4j07xpo,"Starbucks has been working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes. But though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround. Picket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday, as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing. The walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago. Baristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload. ""Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,"" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US. ""You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,"" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May. Starbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the ""vast majority"" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US. During previous coordinated strikes, fewer than 1% of stores participated, the company said, adding that it expected the same turnout this time. But the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment. In recent years the brand has faced consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks. The arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%. He quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal. At the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training. Progress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat. ""We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,"" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts. But the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester. Starbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September. Even after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice. A union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April. The company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would ""significantly affect store operations and customer experience"", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week. ""When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,"" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement. ""Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,"" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30. Unionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months. This continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts. The brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers. ""Happy customers have to come from happy employees,"" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. ""You can't do that top down."" This week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of ""union-busting"" and urging the company to bargain in good faith. Joe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the ""Experience Economy"", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was ""surprised"" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved. ""This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,"" he said."
China-US Relations,Gang jailed for stealing £700k from cash machines,2025-11-26T06:12:13.093Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0pr5q7kg4o,"Six members of a criminal network that stole £700,000 from cash machines across the country have been jailed. Between February and December 2024 the gang, which was based in Romania but operated out of Luton, used sophisticated devices to bypass security systems at cashpoints, investigators said. Late night raids at 51 locations across the UK were carried out to fraudulently withdraw cash in 3,300 separate transactions. Det Insp Dan Barker, from the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), said there was ""no doubt that this group thought they were above the law both here in the UK and in Romania"". After reports were received about fraudulent activity, an investigation was launched by ERSOU which led to detectives uncovering and dismantling the network. An initial five arrests were made in December 2024, with suspects arrested at Luton Airport as they tried to leave the country - and others detained during raids in Luton and Norfolk. Chipboards programmed to bypass cashpoint security measures were seized, along with a cash machine which had been purchased from China. There were indications that new technology was being developed for future offending, ERSOU said. In July, 18 addresses across the Bacau region in Romania were raided with the help of the police in the country and international agencies Europol and Eurojust. Two further arrests were made, with officers seizing a Lamborghini and a Porsche and raiding a stronghold-style property, where the gang's ""FTP"" moniker had been carved into a front gate and printed onto the floor of an outdoor swimming pool. Those arrested were extradited to the UK. Constantin Boghiu, 25, of Kimpton Road, Luton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Alex Militaru, 25, of High Street Watton, Thetford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to two years and five months' imprisonment. Marius Chifan 33, of St Catherines Avenue Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to three years and three months' imprisonment. Gabriel Rosu, 33, of Flowers way Luton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced three and a half years' imprisonment. Razvan Verde, 31, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to launder money, possession of articles for use in fraud and was sentenced to four years and four months' imprisonment. Cristian Cimpoesu, 28, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money and was sentenced to a year and a half in prison. All six men were jailed at Luton Crown Court, but in total nine men were convicted in relation to the fraud. Three other members of the group are due to be sentenced at hearings in December and January, with all facing the prospect of deportation after their sentences. Det Insp Barker added: ""This has been a long running operation involving teams from across Europe, and it's positive that these offenders will now be spending spells behind bars."""
China-US Relations,Battle over Chinese chip maker rocks global car industry,2025-11-11T00:01:10.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43kyn9d6po,"In late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law that saw it take effective control of a Chinese-owned chip company with operations in the country. The extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports. In a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited ""serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia"" that ""posed a threat"". The move allows the Dutch government to ""block decisions if they are harmful or potentially harmful to the company's production"" or to ""the future of Nexperia as a Dutch and European company, and the preservation of this crucial player in Europe's value chain,"" the statement said. The ministry has told the BBC the measure, which is effective for up to a year, does not amount to a takeover of the firm and that the government has no legal control over Nexperia as a result of the action. Beijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference. It imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while shipments of key supplies needed to make chips in China were frozen. The disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China. on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be. But Chinese authorities still want The Hague to revoke its action over Nexperia. ""China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,"" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Nexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a BBC request for comment. At the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem. Nexperia makes so called ""legacy"" or ""building block"" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable. Some vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world. Around 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains. ""Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,"" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter. It underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports. Similar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds. Beijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message. ""The narrative was [that, since] Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,"" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China. That didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement. Wingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government. It was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list. According to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's action over Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company earlier in the year. The documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the ""Chinese owner is problematic"". ""It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,"" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents. The Hague denies its actions were a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China. Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this. ""I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,"" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China. ""Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips."" Experts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China. ""This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,"" said Mr Nunlist. European vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time. It is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips. But supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said. ""Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things."" The incident comes as US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year trade truce - a deal which suspended some export bans and rare earth restrictions. But the Nexperia dispute suggests that this newly-minted agreement may be a fragile one. The US is not going to blow up the deal though, according to Mr Nunlist, and Europe doesn't have much leverage especially in this game of supply chain weaponisation. ""This is really politically tricky for both sides, and for Europe because it doesn't want this to end with chip capacity leaving Europe,"" Mr Nunlist said. ""My understanding is that leaders in Brussels were unaware that the Dutch government was planning to make this move and were unhappy with it."" China and the EU remain locked in urgent negotiations to lift export controls on both chips and rare earths. Talks are continuing with China on finding a ""lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows"", EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X over the weekend. But the episode has exposed vulnerabilities in key supply chains - and ties between China and the Netherlands, and in turn the European Union, are likely to remain under pressure until the discord over Nexperia's ownership and operations is fully resolved."
China-US Relations,"US to sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, Trump says ahead of crown prince's visit",2025-11-18T12:50:24.407Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7512rkvg7ro,"The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,"" Trump said. ""They've been a great ally."" The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago. A US intelligence assessment Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince any role in the murder. Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul. While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a ""pariah"" over its human rights record, Biden in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting. Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the ""largest defence sales agreement in history"", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms. Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers. Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s. One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin. During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects."
China-US Relations,Suspected Hezbollah member goes on trial in Germany,2025-11-18T19:00:18.163Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg72r6myz4o,"A Lebanese man has gone on trial in Celle, northern Germany, accused of being a member of Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group whose military wing is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the EU. The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations. In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a ""foreign operator"" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany. According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running ""an extensive drone programme for some time"". Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had ""systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel"". ""By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units."" To procure such drones ""the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon"", prosecutors said. Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024. The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US. According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers. Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies. Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight. Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added. One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur. Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured. The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder. The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October. Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities."
China-US Relations,The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means,2025-11-16T13:33:18.710Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620qppzlgwo,"South Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States. The US has approved the ""attack submarines"" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday. The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west. Here's what you need to know about the agreement. The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding. In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had ""given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel"". In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha. Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India. South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster. ""I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme. President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose. In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a ""proud achievement"" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North. The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""awake at night"", he added. North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials. In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years. North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme. Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race. ""North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,"" she told the BBC. ""[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension."" It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat. ""South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,"" Dr Yang said. ""What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines."" Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal. Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a ""major change"" which ""means South Korea is now a regional player"". ""The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,"" she said. ""It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries."" For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China. ""Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,"" Dr Yang explained. ""South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea."" US and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea. Beijing must be ""furious"" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said. Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would ""deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides"". Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that ""the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive"". Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline. South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did ""not have the capability"" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use."
